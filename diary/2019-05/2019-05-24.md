Processing /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/www.mydomain.com.conf
2019-05-24 02:16:12,447:WARNING:letsencrypt.client:Registering without email!
** DRY RUN: simulating 'letsencrypt renew' close to cert expiry
**          (The test certificates below have not been saved.)

Congratulations, all renewals succeeded. The following certs have been renewed:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.mydomain.com/fullchain.pem (success)
** DRY RUN: simulating 'letsencrypt renew' close to cert expiry
**          (The test certificates above have not been saved.)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Your account credentials have been saved 
   in your Let's Encrypt configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt.

   You should make a secure backup of this folder now. 
   This configuration directory will also contain certificates 
   and private keys obtained by Let's Encrypt so making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
