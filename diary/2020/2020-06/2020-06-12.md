==> Caveats
GNU "sed" has been installed as "gsed".
If you need to use it as "sed", you can add a "gnubin" directory
to your PATH from your bashrc like:

    PATH="/usr/local/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/gnu-sed/4.8: 12 files, 572.2KB

~~~zsh
% which gsed
/usr/local/bin/gsed
~~~
