Abstract

   Many Internet applications have a need for object-based security
   mechanisms in addition to security mechanisms at the network layer or
   transport layer.  In the past, the Cryptographic Message Syntax has
   provided a binary secure object format based on ASN.1.  Over time,
   the use of binary object encodings such as ASN.1 has been overtaken
   by text-based encodings, for example JavaScript Object Notation.
   This document defines a set of use cases and requirements for a
   secure object format encoded using JavaScript Object Notation, drawn
   from a variety of application security mechanisms currently in
   development.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Internet applications rest on the layered architecture of the
   Internet, and take advantage of security mechanisms at all layers.
   Many applications rely primarily on channel-based security
   technologies, which create a secure channel at the IP layer or
   transport layer over which application data can flow
   [<a href="./rfc4301" title="&quot;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol&quot;">RFC4301</a>][RFC5246].  These mechanisms, however, cannot provide end-
   to-end security in some cases.  For example, in protocols with
   application-layer intermediaries, channel-based security protocols
   would protect messages from attackers between intermediaries, but not
   from the intermediaries themselves.  These cases require object-based
   security technologies, which embed application data within a secure
   object that can be safely handled by untrusted entities.

   The most well-known example of such a protocol today is the use of
   Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protections
   within the email system [<a href="./rfc5751" title="&quot;Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.2 Message Specification&quot;">RFC5751</a>][RFC5322].  An email message
   typically passes through a series of intermediate Mail Transfer
   Agents (MTAs) en route to its destination.  While these MTAs often
   apply channel-based security protections to their interactions (e.g.,
   [<a href="./rfc3207" title="&quot;SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security&quot;">RFC3207</a>]), these protections do not prevent the MTAs from
   interfering with the message.  In order to provide end-to-end
   security protections in the presence of untrusted MTAs, mail users
   can use S/MIME to embed message bodies in a secure object format that
   can provide confidentiality, integrity, and data origin
   authentication.

   S/MIME is based on the Cryptographic Message Syntax for secure
   objects (CMS) [<a href="./rfc5652" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)&quot;">RFC5652</a>].  CMS is defined using Abstract Syntax
   Notation 1 (ASN.1) and traditionally encoded using the ASN.1
   Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER), which define a binary encoding of
   the protected message and associated parameters [<a href="#ref-X.680" title="&quot;Recommendation X.680, &quot;">X.680</a>][X.690].  In
   recent years, usage of ASN.1 has decreased (along with other binary
   encodings for general objects), while more applications have come to
   rely on text-based formats such as the Extensible Markup Language
   (XML) or the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [<a href="#ref-XML" title="&quot;Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)&quot;">XML</a>][RFC4627].

   Many current applications thus have much more robust support for
   processing objects in these text-based formats than ASN.1 objects;
   indeed, many lack the ability to process ASN.1 objects at all.  To
   simplify the addition of object-based security features to these
   applications, the IETF JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)
   working group has been chartered to develop a secure object format
   based on JSON.  While the basic requirements for this object format
   are straightforward -- namely, confidentiality and integrity
   mechanisms, encoded in JSON -- early discussions in the working group
   indicated that many applications hoping to use the formats define in

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft               JOSE Use Cases                   April 2012</span>


   JOSE have additional requirements.  This document summarizes the use
   cases for JOSE envisioned by those applications and the resulting
   requirements for security mechanisms and object encoding.


<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Definitions</span>

   This document makes extensive use of standard security terminology
   [<a href="./rfc4949" title="&quot;Internet Security Glossary, Version 2&quot;">RFC4949</a>].  In addition, because the use cases for JOSE and CMS are
   similar, we will sometimes make analogies to some CMS concepts
   [<a href="./rfc5652" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)&quot;">RFC5652</a>].

   The JOSE working group charter calls for the group to define three
   basic JSON object formats:

   1.  Confidentiality-protected object format

   2.  Integrity-protected object format

   3.  A format for expressing public keys

   In the below, we will refer to these as the "encrypted object
   format", the "signed object format", and the "key format",
   respectively.  In general, where there is no need to distinguish
   between asymmetric and symmetric operations, we will use the terms
   "signing", "signature", etc. to denote both true digital signatures
   involving asymmtric cryptography as well as message authentication
   codes using symmetric keys(MACs).

   In the lifespan of a secure object, there are two basic roles, an
   entity that creates the object (e.g., encrypting or signing a
   payload), and an entity that uses the object (decrypting, verifying).
   We will refer to these roles as "sender" and "recipient",
   respectively.  Note that while some requirements and use cases may
   refer to these as single entities, each object may have multiple
   entities in each role.  For example, a message may be signed by
   multiple senders, or decrypted by multiple recipients.


<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Basic Requirements</span>

   Obviously, for the encrypted and signed object formats, the necessary
   protections will be created using appropriate cryptographic
   mechanisms: symmetric or asymmetric encryption for confidentiality
   and MACs or digital signatures for integrity protection.  In both
   cases, it is necessary for the JOSE format to support both symmetric
   and asymmetric operations.

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft               JOSE Use Cases                   April 2012</span>


   o  The JOSE encrypted object format MUST support object encryption in
      the case where the sender and receiver share a symmetric key.

   o  The JOSE encrypted object format MUST support object encryption in
      the case where the sender has only a public key for the receiver.

   o  The JOSE signed object format MUST integrity protection using
      Message Authentication Codes (MACs), for the case where the sender
      and receiver share a symmetric key.

   o  The JOSE signed object format MUST integrity protection using
      digital signatures, for the case where the receiver has only a
      public key for the sender.

   The purpose of the key format is to provide the recipient with
   sufficient information to use the encoded key to process
   cryptographic messages.  Thus it is necessary to include additional
   parameters along with the bare key.

   o  The JOSE key format MUST include all algorithm parameters
      necesssary to use the encoded key, including an identifier for the
      algorithm with which the key is used as well as any additional
      parameters required by the algorithm (e.g., elliptic curve
      parameters).


<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Use Cases</span>

   Based on early discussions of JOSE, several working groups developing
   application-layer protocols have expressed a desire to use JOSE in
   their designs for end-to-end security features.  In this section, we

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  OAuth</span>

   The OAuth protocol defines a mechanism for distributing and using
   authorization tokens using HTTP [<a href="#ref-I-D.ietf-oauth-v2">I-D.ietf-oauth-v2</a>].  A Client that
   wishes to access a protected resource requests authorization from the
   Resource Owner.  If the Resource Owner allows this access, he directs
   an Authorization Server to issue an access token to the Client.  When
   the Client wishes to access the protected resource, he presents the
   token to the relevant Resource Server, which verifies the validity of
   the token before providing access to the protected resource.

                        Figure 1: The OAuth process

   In effect, this process moves the token from the Authorization Server
   (as a sender of the object) to the Resource Server (recipient), via
   the Client as well as the Resource Owner (the latter because of the
   HTTP mechanics underlying the protocol).  So again we have a case
   where an application object is transported via untrusted
   intermediaries.

   This application has two essential security requirements: Integrity
   and data origin authentication.  Integrity protection is required so
   that the Resource Owner and the Client cannot modify the permission
   encoded in the token.  Data origin authentication is required so that
   the Resource Server can verify that the token was issued by a trusted
   Authorization Server.  Confidentiality protection may also be needed,
   if the Authorization Server is concerned about the visibility of
   permissions information to the Resource Owner or Client.  For
   example, permissions related to social networking might be considered
   private information.  Note, however, that OAuth already requires that
   the underlying HTTP transactions be protected by TLS, so
   confidentiality protection is not strictly necessary for this use
   case.

   The confidentiality and integrity needs are met by the basic
   requirements for signed and encrypted object formats, whether the
   signing and encryption are provided using asymmetric or symmetric
   cryptography.  The choice of which mechanism is applied will depend
   on the relationship between the two servers, namely whether they
   share a symmetric key or only public keys.

   Authentication requirements will also depend on deployment
   characteristics.  Where there is a relatively strong binding between
   the resource server and the authorization server, it may suffice for
   the Authorization Server issuing a token to be identified by the key
   used to sign the token.  This requires that the token carry either
   the public key of the Authorization Server or an identifier for the
   public or symmetric key.

   There may also be more advanced cases, where the Authorization
   Server's key is not known in advance to the Resource Server.  This
   may happen, for instance, if an entity instantiated a collection of
   Authorization Servers (say for load balancing), each of which has an
   independent key pair.  In these cases, it may be necessary to also
   include a certificate or certificate chain for the Authorization
   Server, so that the Resource Server can verify that the Authorization
   Server is an entity that it trusts.

   The HTTP transport for OAuth imposes a particular constraint on the
   encoding.  In the OAuth protocol, tokens frequently need to be passed
   as query parameters in HTTP URIs [<a href="./rfc2616" title="&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1&quot;">RFC2616</a>], after having been
   base64url encoded [<a href="./rfc4648" title="&quot;The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings&quot;">RFC4648</a>].  While there is no prescribed limit on
   the length of URIs (and thus of query parameters), in practice URIs
   of more than around 2,000 characters are rejected by some user
   agents.  So this use case requires that a JOSE object have
   sufficiently small size even after signing, possibly encrypting, and
   base64url encoding.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  XMPP</span>

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) routes messages
   from one end client to another by way of XMPP servers [<a href="./rfc6120" title="&quot;Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core&quot;">RFC6120</a>].
   There are typically two servers involved in delivering any given
   message: The first client (Alice) sends a message for another client
   (B) to her server (A).  Server A uses Bob's identity and the DNS to
   locate the server for Bob's domain (B), then delivers the message to
   that server.  Server B then routes the message to Bob.

            +-------+   +----------+   +----------+   +-----+
            | Alice |--&gt;| Server A |--&gt;| Server B |--&gt;| Bob |
            +-------+   +----------+   +----------+   +-----+

                   Figure 2: Delivering an XMPP message

   The untrusted-intermediary problems are especially acute for XMPP
   because in many current deployments, the holder of an XMPP domain
   outsources the operation of the domain's servers to a different
   entity.  In this environment, there is a clear risk of exposing the
   domain holder's private information to the domain operator.  XMPP

   already has a defined mechanism for end-to-end security using S/MIME,
   but it has failed to gain widespread deployment [<a href="./rfc3923" title="&quot;End-to-End Signing and Object Encryption for the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)&quot;">RFC3923</a>], in part
   because of key management challenges and because of the difficulty of
   processing S/MIME objects.

   The XMPP working group is in the process of developing a new end-to-
   end encryption system with an encoding based on JOSE and a clearer
   key management system [<a href="#ref-I-D.miller-xmpp-e2e">I-D.miller-xmpp-e2e</a>].  The process of sending
   an encrypted message in this system involves two steps: First, the
   sender generates a symmetric Content Encryption Key (CEK), encrypts
   the message content, and sends the encrypted message to the desired
   set of recipients.  Second, each recipient "dials back" to the
   sender, providing his public key; the sender then responds with the
   relevent CEK, wrapped with the recipient's public key.

            +-------+   +----------+   +----------+   +-----+
            | Alice |&lt;-&gt;| Server A |&lt;-&gt;| Server B |&lt;-&gt;| Bob |

                |             |              |           |

                Figure 3: Delivering a secure XMPP message

   The main thing that this system requires from the JOSE formats is
   confidentiality protection via content encryption, plus an integrity
   check via a MAC derived from the same symmetric key.  The separation
   of the key exchange from the transmission of the encrypted content,
   however, requires that the JOSE encrypted object format allow wrapped
   symmetric keys to be carried separately from the encrypted payload.
   In addition, the encrypted object will need to have a tag for the key
   that was used to encrypt the content, so that the recipient (Bob) can
   present the tag to the sender (Alice) when requesting the wrapped
   key.

   Another important feature of XMPP is that it allows for the
   simultaneous delivery of a message to multiple recipients.  In the
   diagrams above, Server A could deliver the message not only to Server
   B (for Bob) but also to Servers C, D, E, etc. for other users.  In
   such cases, to avoid the multiple "dial back" transactions implied by
   the above mechanism, XMPP systems will likely cache public keys for
   end recipients, so that wrapped keys can be sent along with content
   on future messages.  This implies that the JOSE encrypted object
   format must support the provision of multiple versions of the same

   wrapped CEK (much as a CMS EnvelopedData structure can include
   multiple RecipientInfo structures).

   In the current draft of the XMPP end-to-end security system, each
   party is authenticated by virtue of the other party's trust in the
   XMPP message routing system.  The sender is authenticated to the
   receiver because he can receive messages for the identifier "Alice"
   (in particular, the request for wrapped keys), and can originate
   messages for that identifier (the wrapped key).  Likewise, the
   receiver is authenticated to the sender because he received the
   original encrypted message and originated the request for wrapped
   key.  So the authentication here requires not only that XMPP routing
   be done properly, but also that TLS be used on every hop.  Moreover,
   it requires that the TLS channels have strong authentication, since a
   man in the middle on any of the three hops can masquerade as Bob and
   obtain the key material for an encrypted message.

   Because this authentication is quite weak (depending on the use of
   transport-layer security on three hops) and unverifiable by the
   endpoints, it is possible that the XMPP working group will integrate
   some sort of credentials for end recipients, in which case there
   would need to be a way to associate these credentials with JOSE
   objects.

   Finally, it's worth noting that XMPP is based on XML, not JSON.  So
   by using JOSE, XMPP will be carrying JSON objects within XML.  It is
   thus a desirable property for JOSE objects to be encoded in such a
   way as to be safe for inclusion in XML.  Otherwise, an explicit CDATA
   indication must be given to the parser to indicate that it is not to
   be parsed as XML.  One way to meet this requirement would be to apply
   base64url encoding, but for XMPP messages of medium-to-large size,
   this could impose a fair degree of overhead.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  ALTO</span>

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is a system for
   distributing network topology information to end devices, so that
   those devices can modify their behavior to have a lower impact on the
   network [<a href="#ref-I-D.ietf-alto-reqs">I-D.ietf-alto-reqs</a>].  The ALTO protocol distributes topology
   information in the form of JSON objects carried in HTTP
   [<a href="./rfc2616" title="&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1&quot;">RFC2616</a>][I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].  The basic version of ALTO is
   simply a client-server protocol, so simple use of HTTPS suffices for
   this case [<a href="./rfc2818" title="&quot;HTTP Over TLS&quot;">RFC2818</a>].  However, there is beginning to be some
   discussion of use cases for ALTO in which these JSON objects will be
   distributed through a collection of intermediate servers before
   reaching the client, while still preserving the ability of the client
   to authenticate the original source of the object.  Even the base
   ALTO protocol notes that "ALTO clients obtaining ALTO information



<span class="grey">Barnes                   Expires October 8, 2012                [Page 9]</span>

   must be able to validate the received ALTO information to ensure that
   it was generated by an appropriate ALTO server."

   In this case, the security requirements are straightforward.  JOSE
   objects carrying ALTO payloads will need to bear digital signatures
   from the originating servers, which will be bound to certificates
   attesting to the identities of the servers.  There is no requirement
   for confidentiality in this case, since ALTO information is generally
   public.

   The more interesting questions are encoding questions.  ALTO objects
   are likely to be much larger than payloads in the two cases above,
   with sizes of up to several megabytes.  Processing of such large
   objects can be done more quickly if it can be done in a single pass,
   which may be possible if JOSE objects require specific orderings of
   fields within the JSON structure.

   In addition, because ALTO objects are also encoded as JSON, they are
   already safe for inclusion in a JOSE object.  Signed JOSE objects
   will likely carry the signed data in a string alongside the
   signature.  JSON objects have the property that they can be safely
   encoded in JSON strings.  All they require is that unnecessary white
   space be removed, a much simpler transformation than, say base64url
   encoding.  This raises the question of whether it might be possible
   to optimize the JOSE encoding for certain "JSON-safe" cases.

   based secure object format.  At the level of general security
   considerations for object-based security technologies, the security
   considerations for this format are the same as for CMS [<a href="./rfc5652" title="&quot;Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)&quot;">RFC5652</a>].
   The primary difference between the JOSE format and CMS is that JOSE
   is based on JSON, which does not have a canonical representation.
   The lack of a canonical form means that it is difficult to determine
   whether two JSON objects represent the same information, which could
   lead to vulnerabilities in some usages of JOSE.
