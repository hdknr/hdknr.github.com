This\nspecification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described\nin RFC 5849." />

Abstract

   This specification describes the OAuth 2.0 protocol.  OAuth provides
   a method for making authenticated HTTP requests using a token - an
   string used to denote an access grant with specific scope, duration,
   and other attributes.  Tokens are issued to third-party clients by an
   authorization server with the approval of the resource owner.  OAuth
   defines multiple flows for obtaining a token to support a wide range
   of client types and user experience.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   With the increasing use of distributed web services and cloud
   computing, third-party applications require access to server-hosted
   resources.  These resources are usually protected and require
   authentication using the resource owner's credentials (typically a
   username and password).  In the traditional client-server
   authentication model, a client accessing a protected resource on a
   server presents the resource owner's credentials in order to
   authenticate and gain access.

   Resource owners should not be required to share their credentials
   when granting third-party applications access to their protected
   resources.  They should also have the ability to restrict access to a
   limited subset of the resources they control, to limit access
   duration, or to limit access to the HTTP methods supported by these
   resources.

   OAuth provides a method for making authenticated HTTP requests using
   a token - an identifier used to denote an access grant with specific
   scope, duration, and other attributes.  Tokens are issued to third-
   party clients by an authorization server with the approval of the
   resource owner.  Instead of sharing their credentials with the
   client, resource owners grant access by authenticating directly with
   the authorization server which in turn issues a token to the client.
   The client uses the token to authenticate with the resource server
   and gain access.

   For example, a web user (resource owner) can grant a printing service
   (client) access to her protected photos stored at a photo sharing
   service (resource server), without sharing her username and password
   with the printing service.  Instead, she authenticates directly with
   the photo sharing service (authorization server) which issues the
   printing service delegation-specific credentials (token).

   This specification defines the use of OAuth over HTTP [<a href="./rfc2616" title="&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1&quot;">RFC2616</a>] (or
   HTTP over TLS as defined by [<a href="./rfc2818" title="&quot;HTTP Over TLS&quot;">RFC2818</a>]).  Other specifications may
   extend it for use with other transport protocols.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Terminology</span>

   resource server
         An HTTP [<a href="./rfc2616" title="&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1&quot;">RFC2616</a>] server capable of accepting authenticated
         resource requests using the OAuth protocol.

   protected resource
         An access-restricted resource which can be obtained from a
         resource server using an OAuth-authenticated request.

   client
         An HTTP client capable of making authenticated requests for
         protected resources using the OAuth protocol.

   resource owner
         An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.

   end-user
         A human resource owner.

   token
         A string representing an access grant issued to the client.
         The string is usually opaque to the client and can self-contain
         the authorization information in a verifiable manner (i.e.
         signed), or denotes an identifier used to retrieve the
         authorization information.

   access token
         A token used by the client to make authenticated requests on
         behalf of the resource owner.  Access tokens represent a
         specific scope, duration, and other access attributes granted
         by the resource owner and enforced by the resource and
         authorization servers.

   refresh token
         A token used by the client to replace an expired access token
         with a new access token without having to involve the resource
         owner.  A refresh token is used when the access token is valid
         for a shorter time period than the duration of the access grant
         granted by the resource owner.

   authorization server
         An HTTP server capable of issuing tokens after successfully
         authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
         The authorization server may be the same server as the resource
         server, or a separate entity.

   end-user authorization endpoint
         The authorization server's HTTP endpoint capable of
         authenticating the end-user and obtaining authorization.

   token endpoint
         The authorization server's HTTP endpoint capable of issuing
         tokens and refreshing expired tokens.

   client identifier
         An unique identifier issued to the client to identify itself to
         the authorization server.  Client identifiers may have a
         matching secret.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-1.2" href="#section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Overview</span>

   Clients interact with a protected resource, first by requesting
   access (which is granted in the form of an access token) from the
   authorization server, and then by authenticating with the resource
   server by presenting the access token.  Figure 1 demonstrates the
   flow between the client and authorization server (A, B), and the flow
   between the client and resource server (C, D), when the client is
   acting autonomously (the client is also the resource owner).

                   Figure 1: Generic Client-Server Flow

   Access token strings can use any internal structure agreed upon
   between the authorization server and the resource server, but their
   structure is opaque to the client.  Since the access token provides
   the client access to the protected resource for the life of the
   access token (or until revoked), the authorization server should
   issue access tokens which expire within an appropriate time, usually
   much shorter than the duration of the access grant.

   When an access token expires, the client can request a new access
   token from the authorization server by presenting its credentials
   again (Figure 1), or by using the refresh token (if issued with the
   access token) as shown in Figure 2.  Once an expired access token has
   been replaced with a new access token (A, B), the client uses the new

                   Figure 2: Refreshing an Access Token

   This specification defines a number of authorization flows to support
   different client types and scenarios.  These authorization flows can
   be separated into three groups: user delegation flows, direct
   credentials flows, and autonomous flows.

   Additional authorization flows may be defined by other specifications
   to cover different scenarios and client types.

   User delegation flows are used to grant client access to protected
   resources by the end-user without sharing the end-user credentials
   (e.g. a username and password) with the client.  Instead, the end-
   user authenticates directly with the authorization server, and grants
   client access to its protected resources.  The user delegation flows
   defined by this specifications are:

   o  Web Server Flow - This flow is optimized for clients that are part
      of a web server application, accessible via HTTP requests.  This
      flow is described in <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>.

   o  User-Agent Flow - This flow is designed for clients running inside
      a user-agent (typically a web browser).  This flow is described in
      <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a>.

   Direct credentials flows enable clients to obtain an access token
   with a single request using the client credentials or end-user
   credentials without seeking additional resource owner authorization.
   The direct credentials flows defined by this specification are:

   o  Username and Password Flow - This flow is used in cases where the
      end-user trusts the client to handle its credentials but it is



<span class="grey">Hammer-Lahav, et al.    Expires December 13, 2010               [Page 7]</span>

      still undesirable for the client to store the end-user's username
      and password.  This flow is only suitable when there is a high
      degree of trust between the end-user and the client.  This flow is
      described in <a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>.

   o  Client Credentials Flow - The client uses its credentials to
      obtain an access token.  This flow is described in <a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a>.

   Autonomous flows enable clients to utilize existing trust
   relationships or different authorization constructs to obtain an
   access token.  They provide a bridge between OAuth and other trust
   frameworks.  The autonomous authorization flow defined by this
   specifications is:

   o  Assertion Flow - The client presents an assertion such as a SAML
      [<a href="#ref-OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os">OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os</a>] assertion to the authorization server in
      exchange for an access token.  This flow is described in
      <a href="#section-2.5">Section 2.5</a>.

   The sizes of tokens and other values received from the authorization
   server, are left undefined by this specification.  Clients should
   avoid making assumptions about value sizes.  Servers should document
   the expected size of any value they issue.

                         Figure 3: Web Server Flow

   The web server flow illustrated in Figure 3 includes the following
   steps:

   (A)  The web client initiates the flow by redirecting the end-user's
        user-agent to the end-user authorization endpoint as described
        in <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a> using client type "web_server".  The client
        includes its client identifier, requested scope, local state,
        and a redirect URI to which the authorization server will send
        the end-user back once authorization is granted (or denied).

   (B)  The authorization server authenticates the end-user (via the
        user-agent) and establishes whether the end-user grants or
        denies the client's access request.

   (C)  Assuming the end-user granted access, the authorization server
        redirects the user-agent back to the client to the redirection
        URI provided earlier.  The authorization includes a verification
        code for the client to use to obtain an access token.

   (D)  The client requests an access token from the authorization
        server by authenticating and including the verification code
        received in the previous step as described in <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>.

   (E)  The authorization server validates the client credentials and
        the verification code and responds back with the access token.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.2" href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>.  User-Agent Flow</span>

   The user-agent flow is a user delegation flow suitable for client
   applications residing in a user-agent, typically implemented in a
   browser using a scripting language such as JavaScript.  These clients
   cannot keep client secrets confidential and the authentication of the
   client is based on the user-agent's same-origin policy.

   Unlike other flows in which the client makes separate authorization
   and access token requests, the client received the access token as a
   result of the authorization request in the form of an HTTP
   redirection.  The client requests the authorization server to
   redirect the user-agent to another web server or local resource
   accessible to the browser which is capable of extracting the access
   token from the response and passing it to the client.

   This user-agent flow does not utilize the client secret since the
   client executables reside on the end-user's computer or device which
   makes the client secret accessible and exploitable.  Because the
   access token is encoded into the redirection URI, it may be exposed
   to the end-user and other applications residing on the computer or
   device.

   (A)  The client sends the user-agent to the end-user authorization
        endpoint as described in <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a> using client type
        "user-agent".  The client includes its client identifier,

        authorization server will send the end-user back once
        authorization is granted (or denied).

   (B)  The authorization server authenticates the end-user (via the
        user-agent) and establishes whether the end-user grants or
        denies the client's access request.

   (C)  Assuming the end-user granted access, the authorization server
        redirects the user-agent to the redirection URI provided
        earlier.  The redirection URI includes the access token (and an
        optional verification code) in the URI fragment.

   (D)  The user-agent follows the redirection instructions by making an
        HTTP "GET" request to the web server which does not include the
        fragment.  The user-agent retains the fragment information
        locally.  The user-agent MUST NOT include the fragment component
        with the request.

   (E)  The web server returns a web page (typically an HTML page with
        an embedded script) capable of accessing the full redirection
        URI including the fragment retained by the user-agent, and
        extracting the access token (and other parameters) contained in
        the fragment.

   (F)  The user-agent executes the script provided by the web server
        which extracts the access token and passes it to the client.  If
        a verification code was issued, the client can pass it to a web
        server component to obtain another access token for additional
        server-based protected resources interaction.

   The username and password flow is suitable for clients capable of
   asking end-users for their usernames and passwords.  It is also used
   to migrate existing clients using direct authentication schemes such
   as HTTP Basic or Digest authentication to OAuth by converting the
   end-user credentials stored with tokens.

   However, unlike the HTTP Basic authentication scheme defined in

   and are exchanged for an access token and refresh token which
   eliminates the client need to store them for future use.

   The methods through which the client prompts end users for their
   usernames and passwords is beyond the scope of this specification.
   The client MUST discard the usernames and passwords once an access
   token has been obtained.

   This flow is suitable in cases where the end-user already has a trust
   relationship with the client, such as its computer operating system
   or highly privileged applications.  Authorization servers should take
   special care when enabling the username and password flow, and only
   when other delegation flows are not viable.

   The client credentials flow is used when the client acts on behalf of
   itself (the client is the resource owner), or when the client
   credentials are used to obtain an access token representing a
   previously established access authorization.  The client secret is
   assumed to be high-entropy since it is not designed to be memorized

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.5" href="#section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Assertion Flow</span>

   The assertion flow is used when a client wishes to exchange an
   existing security token or assertion for an access token.  This flow
   is suitable when the client is the resource owner or is acting on
   behalf of the resource owner (based on the content of the assertion
   used).

   The assertion flow requires the client to obtain a assertion (such as
   a SAML [<a href="#ref-OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os">OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os</a>] assertion) from an assertion issuer
   or to self-issue an assertion prior to initiating the flow.  The
   assertion format, the process by which the assertion is obtained, and
   the method of validating the assertion are defined by the assertion
   issuer and the authorization server, and are beyond the scope of this
   specification.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.6" href="#section-2.6">2.6</a>.  Native Application Considerations</span>

   Native application are clients running as native code on the end-
   user's computer or device (i.e. executing outside a browser or as a
   desktop program).  These clients are often capable of interacting
   with (or embedding) the end-user's user-agent but are incapable of
   receiving callback requests from the server (incapable of acting as
   an HTTP server).

   Native application clients can utilize many of the flows defined in
   this specification with little or no changes.  For example:

   o  Launch an external user-agent and have it redirect back to the
      client using a custom URI scheme.  This works with the web server
      flow and user-agent flow.

   o  Launch an external user-agent and poll for changes to the window
      title.  This works with the web server flow with a server-hosted
      custom redirect result page that puts the verification code in the
      title.

   o  Use an embedded user-agent and obtain the redirection URI.  This
      works with the web server flow and user-agent flow.

   o  Use the username and password flow and prompt the end-users for
      their credentials.  This is generally discouraged as it hands the
      end-user's password directly to the 3rd party and may not work

      with some authentication schemes.

   When choosing between launching an external browser and an embedded
   user-agent, developers should consider the following:

   o  External user-agents may improve completion rate as the end-user
      may already be logged-in and not have to re-authenticate.

   o  Embedded user-agents often offer a better end-user flow, as they
      remove the need to switch context and open new windows.

   o  Embedded user-agents are less secure because users are
      authenticating in unidentified window without access to the
      protections offered by many user-agents.


<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Client Credentials</span>

   When requesting access from the authorization server, the client
   identifies itself using a set of client credentials.  The client
   credentials include a client identifier and an OPTIONAL symmetric
   shared secret.  The means through which the client obtains these
   credentials are beyond the scope of this specification, but usually
   involve registration with the authorization server.

   The client identifier is used by the authorization server to
   establish the identity of the client for the purpose of presenting
   information to the resource owner prior to granting access, as well
   as for providing different service levels to different clients.  They
   can also be used to block unauthorized clients from requesting
   access.

   Due to the nature of some clients, authorization servers SHOULD NOT
   make assumptions about the confidentiality of client credentials
   without establishing trust with the client operator.  Authorization
   servers SHOULD NOT issue client secrets to clients incapable of
   keeping their secrets confidential.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Client Authentication</span>

   The token endpoint requires the client to authenticate itself to the
   authorization server.  This is done by including the client
   identifier (and optional secret) in the request.  The client
   identifier and secret are included in the request using two request
   parameters: "client_id" and "client_secret".

   For example (line breaks are for display purposes only):


     POST /token HTTP/1.1

     redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb


   The client MAY include the client credentials using an HTTP
   authentication scheme which supports authenticating using a username
   and password, instead of using the "client_id" and "client_secret"
   request parameters.  Including the client credentials using an HTTP
   authentication scheme fulfills the requirements of including the
   parameters as defined by the various flows.

   The client MUST NOT include the client credentials using more than
   one mechanism.  If more than one mechanism is used, regardless if the
   credentials are identical, the server MUST reply with an HTTP 400
   status code (Bad Request) and include the "multiple-credentials"
   error message.

   The authorization server MUST accept the client credentials using
   both the request parameters, and the HTTP Basic authentication scheme
   as defined in [<a href="./rfc2617" title="&quot;HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication&quot;">RFC2617</a>].  The authorization server MAY support
   additional HTTP authentication schemes.

   client attains authorization are codified in the various

   authorization flows defined in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>, and depends on the client
   type and its trust relationship with the resource owner.

   Resource owner authorization can be expressed in multiple ways: a
   verification code obtained through direct interaction with an end-
   user, the resource owner credentials (or the client credentials when
   the client is also the resource owner) obtained through a trust
   relationship with the resource owner, or an assertion obtained
   through means beyond the scope of this specification.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Verification Code</span>

   When an end-user is involved, the client attains authorization in the
   form of a verification code by sending the end-user to the
   authorization server to review and grant the request.  The client
   sends the end-user by directing the end-user's user-agent to the
   authorization server's end-user authorization endpoint.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.1.1" href="#section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  End-User Authorization Endpoint</span>

   When directed to the end-user authorization endpoint, the end-user
   first authenticates with the authorization server, and then grants or
   denies the access request.  The way in which the authorization server
   authenticates the end-user (e.g. username and password login, OpenID,
   session cookies) and in which the authorization server obtains the
   end-user's authorization, including whether it uses a secure channel
   such as TLS, is beyond the scope of this specification.  However, the
   authorization server MUST first verify the identity of the end-user.

   The location of the end-user authorization endpoint can be found in
   the service documentation, or can be obtained by using [[ OAuth
   Discovery ]].  The end-user authorization endpoint URI MAY include a
   query component as defined by <a href="./rfc3986#section-3">[RFC3986] section&nbsp;3</a>, which must be
   retained when adding additional query parameters.

   Since requests to the end-user authorization endpoint result in user
   authentication and the transmission of sensitive information, the
   authorization server SHOULD require the use of a transport-layer
   mechanism such as TLS when sending requests to the end-user
   authorization endpoint.

   In order to direct the end-user's user-agent to the authorization
   server, the client constructs the request URI by adding the following
   parameters to the end-user authorization endpoint URI query component
   using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format as defined by
   [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-html401-19991224">W3C.REC-html401-19991224</a>]:

         Determines how the authorization server delivers the
         authorization response back to the client.  The parameter value
         MUST be set to "web_server" or "user_agent".

   client_id
         REQUIRED.  The client identifier as described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   redirect_uri
         REQUIRED, unless a redirection URI has been established between
         the client and authorization server via other means.  An
         absolute URI to which the authorization server will redirect
         the user-agent to when the end-user authorization step is
         completed.  The authorization server SHOULD require the client
         to pre-register their redirection URI.  Authorization servers
         MAY restrict the redirection URI to not include a query
         component as defined by <a href="./rfc3986#section-3">[RFC3986] section&nbsp;3</a>.

   state
         OPTIONAL.  An opaque value used by the client to maintain state
         between the request and callback.  The authorization server
         includes this value when redirecting the user-agent back to the
         client.

   scope
         OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request expressed as a list
         of space-delimited strings.  The value of the "scope" parameter
         is defined by the authorization server.  If the value contains
         multiple space-delimited strings, their order does not matter,
         and each string adds an additional access range to the
         requested scope.

   The client directs the end-user to the constructed URI using an HTTP
   redirection response, or by other means available to it via the end-
   user's user-agent.  The request MUST use the HTTP "GET" method.

   For example, the client directs the end-user's user-agent to make the
   following HTTPS request (line breaks are for display purposes only):


     GET /authorize?type=web_server&amp;client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&amp;redirect_uri=
         https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com


   If the client has previously registered a redirection URI with the
   authorization server, the authorization server MUST verify that the

   redirection URI received matches the registered URI associated with
   the client identifier. [[ provide guidance on how to perform matching
   ]]

   The authorization server authenticates the end-user and obtains an
   authorization decision (by asking the end-user or by establishing
   approval via other means).  When a decision has been established, the
   authorization server directs the end-user's user-agent to the
   provided client redirection URI using an HTTP redirection response,
   or by other means available to it via the end-user's user-agent.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.1.1.1" href="#section-4.1.1.1">4.1.1.1</a>.  Authorization Server Response</span>

   If the end-user grants the access request, the authorization server
   issues an access token, a verification code, or both, and delivers
   them to the client by adding the following parameters to the
   redirection URI:

   code
         REQUIRED if the client type is "web_server", otherwise
         OPTIONAL.  The verification code generated by the authorization
         server.  The verification code SHOULD expire shortly after it
         is issued and allowed for a single use.  The verification code
         is bound to the client identifier and redirection URI.

   access_token
         REQUIRED if the client type is "user_agent", otherwise MUST NOT
         be included.  The access token.

   expires_in
         OPTIONAL.  The duration in seconds of the access token lifetime
         if an access token is included.

   state
         REQUIRED if the "state" parameter was present in the client
         authorization request.  Set to the exact value received from
         the client.

   If the end-user denies the access request, the authorization server
   informs the client by adding the following parameters to the
   redirection URI:

   error
         REQUIRED.  The parameter value MUST be set to "user_denied".

   state
         REQUIRED if the "state" parameter was present in the client
         authorization request.  Set to the exact value received from
         the client.

   The method in which the authorization server adds the parameter to
   the redirection URI is determined by the client type provided by the
   client in the authorization request using the "type" parameter.

   If the client type is "web_server", the authorization server adds the
   parameters to the redirection URI query component using the
   "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format as defined by
   [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-html401-19991224">W3C.REC-html401-19991224</a>].

   If the client type is "user_agent", the authorization server adds the
   parameters to the redirection URI fragment component using the
   "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format as defined by
   [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-html401-19991224">W3C.REC-html401-19991224</a>]. [[ replace form-encoded with JSON? ]]

   For example, the authorization server redirects the end-user's user-
   agent by sending the following HTTP response:

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Resource Owner Credentials</span>

   While OAuth seeks to eliminate the need for resource owners to share
   their credentials with the client, possesion of the resource owner
   credentials constitute an authorization grant (if supported by the
   authorization server).  Resource owner credentials should only be
   used when there is a high degree of trust between the resource owner
   the client.

   In cases where the client is also the resource owner, the client
   credentials can be used to obtain an access token provisioned for
   accessing the client's protected resources.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Assertion</span>

   Assertions enable the client to utilize existing trust relationships
   or different authorization constructs to obtain an access token.
   They provide a bridge between OAuth and other trust frameworks.  The
   authorization grant represented by an assertion depends on the
   assertion type, its content, and how it was issued, which are beyond
   the scope of this specification.


<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Obtaining an Access Token</span>

   The client obtains an access token by authenticating with the
   authorization server and presenting its authorization grant.

   In many cases it is desirable to issue access tokens with a shorter
   lifetime than the duration of the authorization grant.  However, it
   may be undesirable to require the resource owner to authorize the
   request again.  Instead, the authorization server issues a refresh
   token in addition to the access token.  When the access token
   expires, the client can request a new access token without involving
   the resource owner as long as the authorization grant is still valid.
   The token refresh method is described in <a href="#section-5.1.4">Section 5.1.4</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Token Endpoint</span>

   After obtaining authorization from the resource owner, clients
   request an access token from the authorization server's token
   endpoint.  When requesting an access token, the client authenticates
   with the authorization server and includes the authorization grant
   (in the form of a verification code, resource owner credentials, an
   assertion, or a refresh token).

   The location of the token endpoint can be found in the service
   documentation, or can be obtained by using [[ OAuth Discovery ]].
   The token endpoint URI MAY include a query component, which must be
   retained when adding additional query parameters.

   Since requests to the token endpoint result in the transmission of
   plain text credentials in the HTTP request and response, the
   authorization server MUST require the use of a transport-layer
   mechanism when sending requests to the token endpoints.  Servers MUST
   support TLS 1.2 as defined in [<a href="./rfc5246" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2&quot;">RFC5246</a>] and MAY support addition
   mechanisms with equivalent protections.

   The client obtains an access token by constructing a token request.
   The client constructs the request URI by:

   o  Adding its client credentials to the request as described in
      <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.  For example, if the client uses a set of basic
      client credentials, it adds the "client_id" and "client_secret"
      parameters to the request (or uses the HTTP Basic authentication
      scheme).

   o  Adding the authorization grand in the form of a verification code,
      resource owner credentials, an assertion, or refresh token.  If
      the client is acting on behalf of itself (the client is also the
      resource owner), no additional information is needed.  The
      authorization grant is added to the request URI query component
      using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format as described
      below.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.1" href="#section-5.1.1">5.1.1</a>.  Verification Code</span>

   The client includes the verification code using following parameters:

         REQUIRED.  The verification code received from the
         authorization server.

   redirect_uri
         REQUIRED.  The redirection URI used in the initial request.

   For example, the client makes the following HTTPS request (line
   breaks are for display purposes only):

         multiple space-delimited strings, their order does not matter,
         and each string adds an additional access range to the
         requested scope.

   The authorization server MUST validate the assertion and if valid
   issues an access token response as described in <a href="#section-5.1.5">Section 5.1.5</a>.  The
   authorization server SHOULD NOT issue a refresh token.

   Authorization servers SHOULD issue access tokens with a limited
   lifetime and require clients to refresh them by requesting a new
   access token using the same assertion if it is still valid.
   Otherwise the client MUST obtain a new valid assertion.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.4" href="#section-5.1.4">5.1.4</a>.  Refresh Token</span>

   Token refresh is used when the lifetime of an access token is shorter
   than the lifetime of the authorization grant.  It enables the client
   to obtain a new access token without having to go through the
   authorization flow again or involve the resource owner.

   The client includes the refresh token using the following parameters:

   refresh_token
         REQUIRED.  The refresh token associated with the access token
         to be refreshed.

   parameter at the highest structure level.  Parameter names and string
   values are included as JSON strings.  Numerical values are included
   as JSON numbers.

   The authorization server MUST include the HTTP "Cache-Control"
   response header field with a value of "no-store" in any response
   containing tokens, secrets, or other sensitive information.

   For example:


     HTTP/1.1 200 OK

   For example:

     Host: server.example.com
     Authorization: Token token="vF9dft4qmT"


   Access tokens act as bearer tokens, where the token string acts as a
   shared symmetric secret.  This requires treating the access token
   with the same care as other secrets (e.g. end-user passwords).
   Access tokens SHOULD NOT be sent in the clear over an insecure
   channel.

   However, when it is necessary to transmit bearer tokens in the clear
   without a secure channel, authorization servers SHOULD issue access
   tokens with limited scope and lifetime to reduce the potential risk
   from a compromised access token.

   Clients SHOULD NOT make authenticated requests with an access token
   to unfamiliar resource servers, especially when using bearer tokens,
   regardless of the presence of a secure channel.

   The methods used by the resource server to validate the access token
   are beyond the scope of this specification, but generally involve an
   interaction or coordination between the resource server and
   authorization server.

   The resource server MUST validate the access token and ensure it has
   not expired and that its scope covers the requested resource.  If the
   token expired or is invalid, the resource server MUST reply with an
   HTTP 401 status code (Unauthorized) and include the HTTP
   "WWW-Authenticate" response header as described in <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>.

   For example:


     HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
     WWW-Authenticate: Token realm='Service', error='token_expired'


   Clients make authenticated token requests using the "Authorization"
   request header field as described in <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>.  Alternatively,
   clients MAY include the access token using the HTTP request URI in
   the query component as described in <a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a>, or in the HTTP body
   when using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content type as
   described in <a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a>.

   Clients SHOULD only use the request URI or body when the
   "Authorization" request header field is not available, and MUST NOT
   use more than one method in each request. [[ specify error ]]

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  The Authorization Request Header</span>

   The "Authorization" request header field is used by clients to make
   authenticated token requests.  The client uses the "token" attribute
   to include the access token in the request.

   The "Authorization" header field uses the framework defined by
   [<a href="./rfc2617" title="&quot;HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication&quot;">RFC2617</a>] as follows:

   For example, the client makes the following HTTPS request:


     GET /resource?oauth_token=vF9dft4qmT HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com


   The HTTP request URI query can include other request-specific
   parameters, in which case, the "oauth_token" parameters SHOULD be
   appended following the request-specific parameters, properly
   separated by an "&amp;" character (ASCII code 38).

   The resource server MUST validate the access token and ensure it has
   not expired and its scope includes the requested resource.  If the
   resource expired or is not valid, the resource server MUST reply with
   an HTTP 401 status code (Unauthorized) and include the HTTP
   "WWW-Authenticate" response header as described in <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-6.3" href="#section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Form-Encoded Body Parameter</span>

   When including the access token in the HTTP request entity-body, the
   client adds the access token to the request body using the
   "oauth_token" parameter.  The client can use this method only if the
   following REQUIRED conditions are met:

   o  The entity-body is single-part.

   o  The entity-body follows the encoding requirements of the
      "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content-type as defined by
      [<a href="#ref-W3C.REC-html401-19991224">W3C.REC-html401-19991224</a>].

   o  The HTTP request entity-header includes the "Content-Type" header
      field set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".

   o  The HTTP request method is "POST", "PUT", or "DELETE".

   The entity-body can include other request-specific parameters, in
   which case, the "oauth_token" parameters SHOULD be appended following
   the request-specific parameters, properly separated by an "&amp;"
   character (ASCII code 38).

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Identifying a Protected Resource</span>

   Clients access protected resources after locating the appropriate
   end-user authorization endpoint and token endpoint and obtaining an
   access token.  In many cases, interacting with a protected resource
   requires prior knowledge of the protected resource properties and
   methods, as well as its authentication requirements (i.e.
   establishing client identity, locating the end-user authorization and
   token endpoints).

   However, there are cases in which clients are unfamiliar with the
   protected resource, including whether the resource requires
   authentication.  When clients attempt to access an unfamiliar
   protected resource without an access token, the resource server
   denies the request and informs the client of the required credentials
   using an HTTP authentication challenge.

   In addition, when receiving an invalid authenticated request, the
   resource server issues an authentication challenge including the
   error type and message.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.1" href="#section-7.1">7.1</a>.  The WWW-Authenticate Response Header</span>
