                                 Protocol

   This document is a description of, and a specification for, the NETBLT
   protocol.  It is a revision of the specification published in <a href="./rfc969">RFC-969</a>.
   NETBLT (NETwork BLock Transfer) is a transport level protocol intended
   for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of data between computers.
   It provides a transfer that is reliable and flow controlled, and is
   designed to provide maximum throughput over a wide variety of networks.
   Although NETBLT currently runs on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), it
   should be able to operate on top of any datagram protocol similar in
   function to IP. This document is published for discussion and comment,
   and does not constitute a standard.  The proposal may change and certain
   parts of the protocol have not yet been specified; implementation of this
   document is therefore not advised.  Obsoletes  <a href="./rfc969">RFC-969</a>.

   This memo is an official status report on the network numbers used in
   the Internet community.  As of 1-Mar-87 the Network Information Center
   (NIC) at SRI International has assumed responsibility for assignment of
   Network Numbers and Autonomous System Numbers.  This RFC documents the
   current assignments of these numbers at the time of this transfer of
   responsibility.   Obsoletes <a href="./rfc990">RFC-990</a>, 960, 943, 923 and 900.

   This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the Internet community and
   requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This RFC is the
   outgrowth of a series of IAB Privacy Task Force meetings and of internal
   working papers distributed for those meetings.  This RFC defines message
   encipherment and authentication procedures, as the initial phase of an
   effort to provide privacy enhancement services for electronic mail
   transfer in the Internet. It is intended that the procedures defined
   here be compatible with a wide range of key management approaches,
   including both conventional (symmetric) and public-key (asymmetric)
   approaches for encryption of data encrypting keys.  Use of conventional
   cryptography for message text encryption and/or authentication is
   anticipated.

   the Internet Protocol (IP) to support internetwork multicasting.  This
   specification supersedes that given in <a href="./rfc966">RFC-966</a>, and constitutes a
   proposed protocol standard for IP multicasting in the ARPA-Internet.
   The reader is directed to <a href="./rfc966">RFC-966</a> for a discussion of the motivation and
   rationale behind the multicasting extension specified here.

   The X.400 series protocols have been defined by CCITT to provide an
   Interpersonal Messaging Service (IPMS), making use of a store and
   forward Message Transfer Service.  It is expected that this standard
   will be implemented very widely.  This document describes a set of

   This RFC summarizes the requirements for gateways to be used on networks
   supporting the DARPA Internet protocols.  While it applies specifically
   to National Science Foundation research programs, the requirements are
   stated in a general context and are believed applicable throughout the
   Internet community.  The purpose of this document is to present guidance
   for vendors offering products that might be used or adapted for use in
   an Internet application.  It enumerates the protocols required and gives
   references to RFCs and other documents describing the current

                                 Personal Computers

   This document is a preliminary discussion of the design of a
   personal-computer-based distributed mail system.  Pcmail is a
   distributed mail system that provides mail service to an arbitrary
   number of users, each of which owns one or more personal computers
   (PCs).  The system is divided into two halves.  The first consists of a
   single entity called the "repository".  The repository is a storage
   center for incoming mail.  Mail for a Pcmail user can arrive externally
   from the Internet or internally from other repository users.  The
   repository also maintains a stable copy of each user's mail state.  The
   repository is therefore typically a computer with a large amount of disk
   storage. It is published for discussion and comment, and does not
   constitute a standard.  As the proposal may change, implementation of
   this document is not advised.   See <a href="./rfc993">RFC-993</a>.

                                 TCP

   This memo describes a proposed protocol standard for the ARPA Internet
   community.  The CCITT and the ISO have defined various session,
   presentation, and application recommendations which have been adopted by
   the international community and numerous vendors.  To the largest extent
   possible, it is desirable to offer these higher level services directly
   in the ARPA Internet, without disrupting existing facilities.  This
   permits users to develop expertise with ISO and CCITT applications which
   previously were not available in the ARPA Internet.  The intention is
   that hosts in the ARPA-Internet that choose to implement ISO TSAP
   services on top of the TCP be expected to adopt and implement this
   standard.  Suggestions for improvement are encouraged.

                                 Storage

   The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on a particular problem
   in the ARPA-Internet and possible methods of solution.  Most prior work
   on congestion in datagram systems focuses on buffer management.  In this
   memo the case of a packet switch with infinite storage is considered.
   Such a packet switch can never run out of buffers.  It can, however,
   still become congested.  The meaning of congestion in an
   infinite-storage system is explored.  An unexpected result is found that
   shows a datagram network with infinite storage, first-in-first-out
   queuing, at least two packet switches, and a finite packet lifetime
   will, under overload, drop all packets.  By attacking the problem of
   congestion for the infinite-storage case, new solutions applicable to
   switches with finite storage may be found.  No proposed solutions this
   document are intended as standards for the ARPA-Internet at this time.

   network delays.  Such a service would be useful for tracing the progress
   of complex transactions, synchronizing cached data bases, monitoring
   network performance and isolating problems.  In this memo one such clock
   service design will be described and its performance assessed.  This

   This RFC discussed clock synchronization algorithms for the

   determining accurate time from a set of mutually suspicious network
   clocks has been prompted by several occasions in which errors were found
   in usually reliable, accurate clock servers after thunderstorms which
   disrupted their power supply.  To these sources of error should be added
   those due to malfunctioning hardware, defective software and operator
   mistakes, as well as random errors in the mechanism used to set and
   synchronize clocks.  This report suggests a stochastic model and
   algorithms for computing a good estimator from time-offset samples
   measured between clocks connected via network links.  Included in this
   report are descriptions of certain experiments which give an indication
   of the effectiveness of the algorithms.

   typically use the TFTP protocol, since it is intended that both phases
   reside in PROM on the client.  However BOOTP could also work with other
   protocols such as SFTP or FTP.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol
   for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions

   This memo discusses the utility of "subnets" of Internet networks, which
   are logically visible sub-sections of a single Internet network.  For
   administrative or technical reasons, many organizations have chosen to
   divide one Internet network into several subnets, instead of acquiring a
   set of Internet network numbers.  This memo specifies procedures for the
   use of subnets.  These procedures are for hosts (e.g., workstations).
   The procedures used in and between subnet gateways are not fully
   described.  Important motivation and background information for a
   subnetting standard is provided in <a href="./rfc940">RFC-940</a>.  This RFC specifies a
   protocol for the ARPA-Internet community.  If subnetting is implemented
   it is strongly recommended that these procedures be followed.

   Many systems provide a mechanism for finding out where a user is logged
   in from usually including information about telephone extension and
   office occupants names.  The information is useful for physically
   locating people and/or calling them on the phone.  In 1982 CMU designed
   and implemented a terminal location database and modified existing
   network software to handle a 64-bit number called the Terminal Location
   Number (or TTYLOC).  It now seems appropriate to incorporate this
   mechanism into the TCP-based network protocol family.  The mechanism is
   not viewed as a replacement for the Terminal Location Telnet Option
   (SEND-LOCATION) but as a shorthand mechansim for communicating terminal
   location information between hosts in a localized community.  This RFC
   proposes a new option for Telnet for the ARPA-Internet community, and

                                 Subnetting

   Several sites now contain a complex of local links connected to the
   Internet via a gateway.  The details of the internal connectivity are of
   little interest to the rest of the Internet.  One way of organizing
   these local complexes of links is to use the same strategy as the
   Internet uses to organize networks, that is, to declare each link to be
   an entity (like a network) and to interconnect the links with devices
   that perform routing functions (like gateways).  This general scheme is
   called subnetting, the individual links are called subnets, and the
   connecting devices are called subgateways (or bridges, or gateways).
   This RFC discusses standardizing the protocol used in subnetted
   environments in the ARPA-Internet.

                                 Scheme

   There have been several proposals for schemes to allow the use of a
   single Internet network number to refer to a collection of physical
   networks under common administration which are reachable from the rest
   of the Internet by a common route.  Such schemes allow a simplified view
   of an otherwise complicated topology from hosts and gateways outside of
   this collection.  They allow the complexity of the number and  type of
   these networks, and routing to them, to be localized.  Additions and
   changes in configuration thus cause no detectable change, and no
   interruption of service, due to slow propagation of routing and other
   information outside of the local environment.  These schemes also
   simplify the administration of the network, as changes do not require
   allocation of new network numbers for each new cable installed.  This
   proposal discusses an alternative scheme, one that has been in use at
   the University of California, Berkeley since April 1984.  This RFC
   suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and
   requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.

   This memo concerns itself with message forwarding.  Forwarding can be
   thought of as encapsulating one or more messages inside another.
   Although this is useful for transfer of past correspondence to new
   recipients, without a decapsulation process (which this memo terms
   "bursting"), the forwarded messages are of little use to the recipients
   because they can not be distributed, forwarded, replied-to, or otherwise
   processed as separate individual messages. In order to burst a message
   it is necessary to know how the component messages were encapsulated in
   the draft.  At present there is no unambiguous standard for interest
   group digests.  This RFC proposes a proposed protocol for the
   ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.

   The problem of treating a set of local area networks (LANs) as one
   Internet network has generated some interest and concern.  It is
   inappropriate to give each LAN within an site a distinct Internet
   network number.  It is desirable to hide the details of the
   interconnections between the LANs within an site from people, gateways,
   and hosts outside the site.  The question arises on how to best do this,
   and even how to do it at all.  In <a href="./rfc917">RFC-917</a> Jeffery Mogul makes a case for
   the use of "explicit subnets" in a multi-LAN environment.  The explicit
   subnet scheme is a call to recursively apply the mechanisms the Internet
   uses to manage networks to the problem of managing LANs within one
   network.  In this note I urge another approach: the use of "transparent
   subnets" supported by a multi-LAN extension of the Address Resolution
   Protocol.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.

   This memo states the requirements on establishing a Domain, and
   introduces the limited set of top level domains.  This memo is a policy
   statement on the requirements of establishing a new domain in the
   ARPA-Internet and the DARPA research community.  This is an official
   policy statement of the IAB and the DARPA.

   This RFC proposes simple rules for broadcasting Internet datagrams on
   local networks that support broadcast, for addressing broadcasts, and
   for how gateways should handle them.  This RFC suggests a proposed
   protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and
   suggestions for improvements.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-918" href="#section-918">918</a>     Reynolds     Oct 84      Post Office Protocol (POP)</span>

   This RFC suggests a simple method for workstations to dynamically access
   mail from a mailbox server.  The intent of the Post Office Protocol
   (POP) is to allow a user's workstation to access mail from a mailbox
   server.  It is expected that mail will be posted from the workstation to
   the mailbox server via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).  This
   RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-917" href="#section-917">917</a>     Mogul        Oct 84      Internet Subnets</span>

   This memo discusses subnets and proposes procedures for the use of
   subnets, including approaches to solving the problems that arise,
   particularly that of routing.  A subnet of an Internet network is a
   logically visible sub-section of a single Internet network.  For
   administrative or technical reasons, many organizations have chosen to
   divide one Internet network into several subnets, instead of acquiring a
   set of Internet network numbers.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol
   for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
   for improvements.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-916" href="#section-916">916</a>     Finn         Oct 84      Reliable Asynchronous Transfer Protocol</span>
                                 (RATP)

   This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community,
   and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. This paper
   proposes and specifies a protocol which allows two programs to reliably
   communicate over a communication link.  It ensures that the data entering
   one end of the link if received arrives at the other end intact and
   unaltered.  The protocol, named RATP, is designed to operate over a full
   duplex point-to-point connection.  It contains some features which tailor
   it to the RS-232 links now in common use.

   This RFC proposed a new service for the ARPA-Internet community and
   requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  The network mail
   path service fills the current need of people to determine mailbox
   addresses for hosts that are not part of the ARPA-Internet but can be
   reached by one or more relay hosts that have Unix to Unix Copy (UUCP)
   mail, CSNET mail, MAILNET mail, BITNET mail, etc.  Anyone can use the
   service if they have TCP/TELENET to one of the hosts with a mail path server.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-914" href="#section-914">914</a>     Farber       Sep 84      A Thinwire Protocol</span>

   This RFC focuses discussion on the particular problems in the
   ARPA-Internet of low speed network interconnection with personal
   computers, and possible methods of solution.  None of the proposed
   solutions in this document are intended as standards for the
   ARPA-Internet.  Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge
   as to the appropriate solution to the problems, leading eventually to
   the adoption of standards.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-913" href="#section-913">913</a>     Lottor       Sep 84      Simple File Transfer Protocol</span>

   This memo describes a proposed Simple File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).  It
   fills the need of people wanting a protocol that is more useful than
   TFTP but easier to implement (and less powerful) than FTP.  SFTP
   supports user access control, file transfers, directory listing,
   directory changing, file renaming and deleting.  Discussion of this
   proposal is encouraged, and suggestions for improvements may be sent to
   the author.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-912" href="#section-912">912</a>     StJohns      Sep 84      Authentication Service</span>

   This memo describes a proposed authentication protocol for verifying the
   identity of a user of a TCP connection.  Given a TCP port number pair,
   it returns a character string which identifies the owner of that
   connection on the server's system.  Suggested uses include automatic
   identification and verification of a user during an FTP session,
   additional verification of a TAC dial up user, and access verification
   for a generalized network file server.

   This memo describes an implementation of the Exterior Gateway Protocol
   (EGP) (in that sense it is a status report).  The memo also discusses
   some possible extentions and some design issues (in that sense it is an

   This memo is a report on a meeting about the experimental multimedia
   mail system (and in a sense a status report on that experiment).  The
   meeting was held at Bolt Beranek and Newman on 23-24 July 1984 to
   discuss recent progress by groups who are building multimedia mail
   systems and to discuss a variety of issues related to the further
   development of multimedia systems.  Representatives were present from
   BBN, ISI, SRI and Linkabit.

   The Loader Debugger Protocol (LDP) is an application layer protocol for
   loading, dumping, and debugging target machines from hosts in a network
   environment.  This RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the
   ARPA-Internet and DARPA research community, and requests discussion and
   suggestions for improvemts.

   This document specifies the Host Access Protocol (HAP).  Although HAP
   was originally designed as the network-access level protocol for the
   DARPA/DCA sponsored Wideband Packet Satellite Network, it is intended
   that it evolve into a standard interface SATNET and TACNET (aka MATNET)
   as well as the Wideband Network.  HAP is an experimental protocol, and
   will undergo further revision as new capabilities are added and/or
   different satellite networks are suported.  Implementations of HAP
   should be performed in coordination with satellite network development
   and operations personnel.
