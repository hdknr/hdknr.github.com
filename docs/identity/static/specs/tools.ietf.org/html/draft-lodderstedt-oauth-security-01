<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document gives security considerations based on a comprehensive
   threat model for the OAuth 2.0 Protocol [<a href="#ref-I-D.ietf-oauth-v2">I-D.ietf-oauth-v2</a>].  It
   contains the following content:

   o  Documents any assumptions and scope considered when creating the
      threat model

   o  Describe the security features in-built into the OAuth protocol
      and how they are intended to thwart attacks

   o  Give a comprehensive threat model for OAuth and describes the
      respective counter measures to thwart those threats.

   Threats include any intentional attacks on OAuth tokens and resources
   protected by OAuth tokens as well as security risks introduced if the
   proper security measures are not put in place.  Threats are
   structured along the lines of the protocol structure to aid
   development teams implement each part of the protocol securely.  For
   example all threats for granting access or all threats for a
   particular client profile or all threats for protecting the resource
   server.


<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Overview</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Scope</span>

   The security considerations document only considers clients bound to
   a particular deployment as supported by [<a href="#ref-I-D.ietf-oauth-v2">I-D.ietf-oauth-v2</a>].  Such
   deployments have the following characteristics:

   o  Resource server URLs are static and well-known at development
      time, authorization server URLs can be static or discovered.

   o  Token scope values (e.g. applicable URLs and methods) are well-
      known at development time.

   o  Client registration: Since registration of clients is out of scope
      of the current core spec, this document assumes a broad variety of
      options from static registration during development time to
      dynamic registration at runtime.

   The following are considered out of scope :

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft             OAuth 2.0 Security                 March 2011</span>


   o  Communication between authorization server and resource server

   o  Token formats

   o  Except for "Resource Owner Password Credentials" (see
      [<a href="#ref-I-D.ietf-oauth-v2">I-D.ietf-oauth-v2</a>], section 4.3), the mechanism used by
      authorization servers to authenticate the user

   o  Mechanism by which a user obtained an assertion and any resulting
      attacks mounted as a result of the assertion being false.

   o  Clients are not bound to a specific deployment: An example could
      by a mail client with support for contact list access via the
      portable contacts API (see [<a href="#ref-portable-contacts">portable-contacts</a>]).  Such clients
      cannot be registered upfront with a particular deployment and must
      dynamically discover the URLs relevant for the Oauth protocol.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.2" href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Attack Assumptions</span>

   The following assumptions relate to an attacker and resources
   available to an attacker:

   o  It is assumed the attacker has full access to the network between
      the client and service provider and may eaves drop on any
      communications between the two.

   o  It is assumed an attacker has unlimited resources to mount an
      attack.

   o  It is assumed that 2 parties involved in the OAuth 3 legged
      protocol may collude to mount an attack against the 3rd party.
      For example, the client and authorization server may be under
      control of an attacker and collude to trick a user to gain access
      to resources.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.3" href="#section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Architectural assumptions</span>

   This section documents the assumptions about the features,
   limitations and design options of the different entities of a OAuth
   deployment along with the security-sensitive data-elements managed by
   those entity.  These assumptions are the foundation of the treat
   analysis.

   The OAuth protocol leaves deployments with a certain degree of
   freedom how to implement and apply the standard.  The core
   specification defines the core concepts of an authorization server
   and an resource server.  Both servers can be implemented in the same
   server entity, or they may also be different entities.  The later is

   Such clients typically represent a web site with its own user
   management and login mechanism and have the following
   characteristics:

   o  Tokens are bound to a single user identity at the site

   o  Web servers are able to protect client secrets

   o  The potential number of tokens affected by a security breach
      depends on number of site users.

   Such clients are implemented using the authorization code flow (see

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-2.3.3.2" href="#section-2.3.3.2">2.3.3.2</a>.  Native Applications</span>

   This class of OAuth clients represent apps running on a user-
   controlled device, such as a notebook, PC, Tablet, Smartphone, or
   Gaming Console.

   Massively distributed applications such as these cannot reliably keep
   secrets confidential, which are issued per software package.  This is
   because such secrets would need to be transferred to the user device
   as part of the installation process.  An attacker could reverse
   engineer any secret from the binary or accompanying resources.
   Native Applications are able to protect per installation/instance
   secrets (e.g. refresh tokens) to some extent.

   Device platforms typically allow users to lock the device with a pin
   and to segregate different apps or users (multi-user operation
   systems).

   Some devices can be identified/authenticated (to varying degrees of
   assurance):

   o  Handsets and smart phones by its International Mobile Equipment
      Identity (IMEI)

   o  Set top boxes, gaming consoles, others by using certificates and
      TPM module - Note: This does not help to identify client apps but

      may be used to bound tokens to devices and to detect token theft

   Mobile devices, such as handsets or smart phones have the following
   special characteristics:

   o  Limited input capabilities, therefore such clients typically
      obtain a refresh token in order to provide automatic login for
      sub-sequent application sessions

   o  As mobile and small devices, they can get cloned, stolen or lost
      easier than other devices.

   o  Security breach will affect single user (or a few users) only.

   For the purposes of this document, the scenario of attackers who
   control a smartphone device entirely is out of scope.

   There are several implementation options for native applications:

   o  The authorization code flow in combination with an embedded or
      external browser (<a href="#section-4.4.1">Section 4.4.1</a>)

   o  The implicte grant flow in combination with an embedded or
      external browser (<a href="#section-4.4.2">Section 4.4.2</a>)

   o  The resource owner password credentials flow can be used as well

   Different threats exists for those implementation options, which are

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Security Features</span>

   These are some of the security features which have been built into
   the OAuth 2.0 protocol to mitigate attacks and security issues.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Tokens</span>

   OAuth makes extensive use of tokens.  Tokens can be implemented in 2
   ways as follows:

   Handle (or artifact)  a reference to some internal data structure
      within the authorization server, the internal data structure
      contains the attributes of the token, such as user id, scope, etc.
      Handles typically require a communication between resource server
      and token server in order to validate the token and obtain token-
      bound data.  Handles enable simple revocation and do not require
      cryptographic mechanisms to protected token content from being
      modified.  As a disadvantage, they require additional resource/
      token server communication impacting on performance and
      scalability.  An authorization code (OAuth <a href="#section-4.1.2">Section 4.1.2</a>) is an
      example of a 'handle' token.  An access token may also be
      implemented as a handle token.  A 'handle' token is often referred
      to as an 'opaque' token because the resource server does not need
      to be able to interpret the token directly, it simply uses the
      token.

   Assertions (aka self-contained token)  a parseable token.  An
      assertion typically has a duration, an audience, and is digitally
      signed containing information about the user and the client.
      Examples of assertion formats are SAML assertions and Kerberos
      tickets.  Assertions can typically directly be validated and used
      by a resource server without interactions with the authorization
      server.  This results in better performance and scalability.
      Implementing token revocation is more difficult with assertions
      than with handles.

   Tokens can be sent to resource server in two ways:

   bearer token  A 'bearer token' is a token that can be used by any
      client who has received the token (cf. [<a href="#ref-I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-bearer">I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-bearer</a>]
      .  Because mere possession is enough to use the token it is
      important that communication between end-points be secured to
      ensure that only authorized end-points may capture the token.  The
      bearer token is convenient to client applications as it does not
      require them to do anything to use them (such as a proof of

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft             OAuth 2.0 Security                 March 2011</span>


      identity).  Bearer tokens have similar characteristics to web SSO
      cookies used in browsers.

   proof token  A 'proof token' is a token that can only be used by a
      specific client.  Each use of the token, requires the client to
      perform some action that proves that it is the authorized user of
      the token.  Examples of this are MAC (mutual authentication) and
      HoK (holder-of-key) tokens (cf. [<a href="#ref-I-D.hammer-oauth-v2-mac-token">I-D.hammer-oauth-v2-mac-token</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Scope</span>

   A Scope represents the access authorization associated with a
   particular token with respect to resource servers, resources and
   methods on those resources.  Scopes are the OAuth way to explicitly
   manage the power associated with an access token.  A scope can be
   controlled by the authorization server and/or the end-user in order
   to limit access to resources for OAuth clients these parties deem
   less secure or trustworthy.  Optionally, the client can request the
   scope to apply to the token but only for lesser scope than would
   otherwise be granted, e.g. to reduce the potential impact if this
   token is sent over non secure channels.  A scope is typically
   complemented by a restriction on a token's lifetime.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Expires_In</span>

   Expires_In allows an authorization server (based on its policies or
   on behalf of the end-user) to limit the lifetime of the access token.
   This mechanisms can be used to issue short-living tokens to OAuth
   clients the authorization server deems less secure or where sending
   tokens over non secure channels.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Authorization Code</span>

   An Authorization Code represents the intermediary result of a
   successful end-user authorization process and is used by the client
   to obtain access and refresh token.  Authorization codes are sent to
   the client's redirect_uri instead of tokens for two purposes.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.5" href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Redirect-URI</span>

   A Redirect-uri helps to identify clients and prevents phishing
   attacks from other clients attempting to trick the user into
   believing the phisher is the client.  The redirect URI is pre-
   registered as requests with authorization code or token will be
   directed to that URI.  Moreover, the value of the actual redirect_uri
   has to be presented and is verified when an authorization code is
   exchanged for tokens.  This helps to prevent session fixation
   attacks.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.6" href="#section-3.6">3.6</a>.  Access Token</span>

   An Access Token is used by a client to access a resource.  An access
   token must be acquired using a HTTP POST operation to ensure no
   logging or caching of requests.  Access tokens typically have short
   life-spans (minutes or hours) that cover typical session lifetimes.
   An access token may be refreshed through the use of a Refresh Token.

   The short lifespan of an access token enables the possibility of
   revocation by requiring the client to refresh their access token at
   regular intervals.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.7" href="#section-3.7">3.7</a>.  Refresh Token</span>

   A Refresh Token is coupled with a short access token lifetime, can be
   used to grant longer access to resources without involving end user
   authorization.  This offers an advantage where resource servers and
   authorization servers are not the same entity, e.g. in a distributed
   environment, as the refresh token must always be exchanged at the
   authorization server.  The authorization server can revoke the
   refresh token at any time causing the granted access to be revoked
   once the current access token expires.  Because of this, a short
   access token lifetime is important if timely revocation is a high
   priority.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.8" href="#section-3.8">3.8</a>.  Client Authentication</span>

   Authentication protocols have typically not taken into account the
   identity of the software component acting on behalf of the end-user.
   OAuth does this in order to increase security level in delegated
   authorization scenarios and because the client will be able to act
   without the user's presence.  By authenticating a client when
   requesting an access token, the token service is able to assess
   whether a given client and authorization code meets appropriate
   security requirements and binds the authorization code approved by
   the user to the client making the request.

   OAuth uses the _client_id_ to collate associated request to the same
   originator, such as

   o  a particular end-user authorization process and the corresponding
      request on the tokens endpoint to exchange the authorization code
      for tokens or

   o  the initial authorization and issuance of a tokens by an end-user
      to a particular client and sub-sequent requests by this client to
      obtain tokens w/o user consent (automatic processing of repeated
      authorization)



<span class="grey">Lodderstedt, et al.    Expires September 15, 2011              [Page 10]</span>

   The client identity may also be used by the authorization server to
   display relevant registration information to a user when requesting
   consent for scope requested by a particular client.  The client
   identity may be used to limit the number of request for a particular
   client or to charge the client per request.  Client Identity may
   furthermore be useful to differentiate (e.g. in server log files)
   between accesses by end-user, and delegated accesses by client on
   behalf of a user.

   The _client_secret_ is used to verify the client identifier.  This
   should only be used where the client is capable of keeping its secret
   confidential.  The client identity can also be verified using the
   _redirect_uri_ or by the _end-user_.

   Clients (and the trustworthiness of its identity) can be classifed by
   using the following parameters:

   o  Deployment-specific or -independent client_id (Note: for native
      apps, every installation of a particular app on a certain device
      is considered a deployment.)

   o  Validated properties, such as app name or redirect_uri

   o  Client_secret available

   Typical client categories are:

   Deployment-independent client_id with pre-registered redirect_uri and
   without client_secret  Such an identity is used by multiple
      installations of the same software package.  The identity of such
      a client can only be validated with the help of the end-user.
      This is a viable option for native apps in order to identify the
      client for the purpose of displaying meta information about the
      client to the user and to differentiate clients in log files.
      Revocation of such an identity will affect ALL deployments of the
      respective software.

   Deployment-independent client_id with pre-registered redirect_uri and
   with client_secre  This is an option for native applications only,
      since web application would require different redirect URIs.  This
      category is not advisable because the client secret cannot be
      protected appropriately (cf. <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>).  Due to its security
      weaknesses, such client identities have the same trustlevel as
      deployment-independent clients without secret.  Revocation will
      affect ALL deployments.

   Deployment-specific client_id with pre-registered redirect_uri and
   with client_secret  The client registration process insures the
      validation of the client's properties, such as redirect_uri,
      website address, web site name, contacts.  Such a client identity
      can be utilized for all relevant use cases cited above.  This
      level can be achieved for web applications in combination with a
      manual or user-bound registration process.  Achieving this level
      for native applications is much more difficult.  Either the
      installation of the app is conducted by an administrator, who
      validates the clients authenticity, or the process from validating
      the app to the installation of the app on the device and the
      creation of the client credentials is controlled end-to-end by a
      single entity (e.g. app market provider).  Revocation will affect
      a single deployment only.

   Deployment-specific client_id with client_secret without validated
   properties  Such a client can be recognized by the authorization
      server in transactions with subsequent requests (e.g.
      authorization and token issuance, refresh token issuance and
      access token refreshment).  Automatic processing of re-
      authorizations could be allowed as well.  Such client credentials
      can be generated automatically without any validation of client
      properties, which makes it another option especially for native
      apps.  Revocation will affect a single deployment only.

   Use of the client secret is considered a relatively weak form of
   credential for the client.  Use of stronger mechanisms such as a
   client assertion (e.g.  SAML), key cryptography, are preferred.

   o  replay its tokens and authorization codes, or

   o  obtain tokens on behalf of the attacked client with the privileges
      of that client.

   The resulting impact would be:

   o  Client authentication of access to authorization server can be
      bypassed

   o  Stolen refresh tokens or authorization codes can be replayed

   Depending on the client category, there are the following approaches
   an attacker could utilize to obtain the client secret.

   *Attack: Obtain Secret From Source Code or Binary.* This applies for
   all client profiles and especially for open source projects, where
   the source code is public accessible.  Even if the attacker does not
   has access to the source code, it could reverse engineer secrets from
   the binary of native apps.

   _Countermeasures:_

   o  Don't issue secrets to clients with inappropriate security policy

   different client types and further specialized countermeasures.  Some
   generally applicable countermeasure to mitigate such attacks shall be

   Exposure of all refresh tokens on that side.

   _Countermeasures:_

   o  Standard web server protection measures - <a href="#section-5.3.2">Section 5.3.2</a>

   o  Use strong client authentication (e.g. client_assertion /

   *Attack: Obtain Refresh Token from Native clients.* On native
   clients, leakage of a refresh token typically affects a single user,
   only.

   _Read from local filesystem:_ The attacker could try get file system
   access on the device and read the refresh tokens.  The attacker could
   utilize a malicious app for that purpose.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.1.3" href="#section-4.1.3">4.1.3</a>.  Threat: Obtain Access Tokens</span>

   Depending on the client type, there are different ways access tokens
   may be revealed to an attacker.  Access tokens could be stolen from
   the device if the app stores them in a storage, which is accessible
   to other applications.

   Impact: Where the token is a bearer token and no additional mechanism
   is used to identify the client, the attacker can access all resources
   associated with the token and its.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Keep access tokens in transient memory and limit grants:
      <a href="#section-5.1.6">Section 5.1.6</a>

   o  Limited scope tokens - <a href="#section-5.1.5.1">Section 5.1.5.1</a>

   o  Keep access tokens in private memory or apply same protection
      means as for refresh tokens - <a href="#section-5.2.2">Section 5.2.2</a>

        embedded browser

   A malicious app could attempt to phish end-user passwords by misusing
   an embedded browser in the end-user authorization process, or by
   presenting its own user-interface instead of allowing trusted system
   browser to render the authorization UI.  By doing so, the usual
   visual trust mechanisms may be bypassed (e.g.  TLS confirmation, web
   site mechanisms).  By using an embedded or internal client app UI,
   the client app has access to additional information it should not
   have access to (e.g. uid/password).

   Impact: If the client app or the communication is compromised, the
   user would not be aware and all information in the authorization
   exchange could be captured such as username and password.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Client developers and end-user can be educated to trust an
      external System-Browser only.

   o  Client apps could be validated prior publication in a app market.

   o  Client developers should not collect authentication information
      directly from users and should instead use redirects to and back
      from a trusted external system-browser.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.2.1" href="#section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  Threat: Password phishing by counterfeit authorization server</span>

   OAuth makes no attempt to verify the authenticity of the
   Authorization Server.  A hostile party could take advantage of this
   by intercepting the Client's requests and returning misleading or
   otherwise incorrect responses.  This could be achieved using DNS or
   ARP spoofing.  Wide deployment of OAuth and similar protocols may
   cause Users to become inured to the practice of being redirected to
   websites where they are asked to enter their passwords.  If Users are
   not careful to verify the authenticity of these websites before
   entering their credentials, it will be possible for attackers to
   exploit this practice to steal Users' passwords.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Service providers should consider such attacks when developing
      services based on OAuth, and should require transport-layer
      security for any requests where the authenticity of the Service
      Provider or of request responses is an issue (see <a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a>).

   o  Service Providers should attempt to educate Users about the risks
      phishing attacks pose, and should provide mechanisms that make it
      easy for Users to confirm the authenticity of their sites.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.2.2" href="#section-4.2.2">4.2.2</a>.  Threat: User unintentionally grants too much access scope</span>

   When obtaining end user authenticaton, the end-user may not
   understand the scope of the access being granted and to whom or they
   may end up providing a client with access to resources which should
   not be permitted.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Explain the scope (resources and the permissions) the user is
      about to grant in a understandable way - <a href="#section-5.2.4.2">Section 5.2.4.2</a>

   o  Narrow scope based on client-specific policy - When obtaining end
      user authorization and where the client requests scope, the
      service provider may want to consider whether to honour that scope
      based on who the client is.  That decision is between the client
      and service provider and is outside the scope of this spec.  The
      service provider may also want to consider what scope to grant
      based on the profile used, e.g. providing lower scope where no
      client secret is provided from a native application. -
      <a href="#section-5.1.5.1">Section 5.1.5.1</a>

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.2.3" href="#section-4.2.3">4.2.3</a>.  Threat: Malicious client obtains existing authorization by fraud</span>

   Authorization servers may wish to automatically process authorization
   requests from Clients which have been previously authorized by the
   user.  When the User is redirected to the authorization server's end-
   user authorization endpoint to grant access, the authorization server
   detects that the User has already granted access to that particular
   Client.  Instead of prompting the User for approval, the
   authorization server automatically redirects the User back to the
   Provider.

   A malicious client may exploit that feature and try to obtain such an
   authorization code instead of the legimate client.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Service providers should not automatically process repeat
      authorizations where the client is not authenticated through a
      client secret or some other authentication mechanism such as
      signing with security certs (see <a href="#section-5.2.3.7">Section 5.2.3.7</a>) or validation of
      a pre-registered redirect uri (<a href="#section-5.2.3.5">Section 5.2.3.5</a> )

   o  Service Providers can mitigate the risks associated with automatic
      processing by limiting the scope of Access Tokens obtained through
      automated approvals - <a href="#section-5.1.5.1">Section 5.1.5.1</a>

   The OAuth specification does not describe any mechanism for
   protecting Tokens from eavesdroppers when they are transmitted from
   the Service Provider to the Client.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Service Providers MUST ensure that these transmissions are
      protected using transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS or SSL (see
      <a href="#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1</a>).

   o  If end-to-end confidentiality cannot be guaranteed, reducing scope

   Service Provider Grants an Access Token.

   Note: A description of a similar attack on the SAML protocol can be

   Countermeasures:

   o  The authorization server SHOULD enforce a one time usage
      restriction (see <a href="#section-5.1.5.4">Section 5.1.5.4</a>).

   o  Authorization server as well as the client MUST ensure that these

   o  Referer headers: browsers frequently pass a "referer" header when
      a web page embeds content, or when a user travels from one web
      page to another web page.  These referer headers may be sent even
      when the origin site does not trust the destination site.  The
      referer header is commonly logged for traffic analysis purposes.

   o  Request logs: web server request logs commonly include query
      parameters on requests.

   o  Open redirectors: web sites sometimes need to send users to
      another destination via a redirector.  Open redirectors pose a
      particular risk to web-based delegation protocols because the
      redirector can leak verification codes to untrusted destination
      sites.

   o  Browser history: web browsers commonly record visited URLs in the
      browser history.  Another user of the same web browser may be able
      to view URLs that were visited by previous users.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.4.1.6" href="#section-4.4.1.6">4.4.1.6</a>.  Threat: Authorization code phishing</span>

   A hostile party could act as the client web server and get access to
   the authorization code.  This could be achieved using DNS or ARP
   spoofing.

   Impact: This affects web applications and may lead to a disclosure of
   authorization codes and, potentially, the corresponding access and
   refresh tokens.

   Countermeasures:

   o  The browser shall be utilized to authenticate the redirect_uri of
      the client using server authentication - <a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a>

   o  The authorization server shall require the client to authenticate
      with a secret, so the binding of the authorization code to a
      certain client can be validated in a reliable way (see
      <a href="#section-5.2.4.4">Section 5.2.4.4</a>).

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.4.1.7" href="#section-4.4.1.7">4.4.1.7</a>.  Threat: Session fixation</span>

   The session fixation attack leverages the 3-legged OAuth flow in an
   attempt to get another user to log-in and authorize access on behalf
   of the attacker.  The victim, seeing only a normal request from an
   expected application, approves the request.  The attacker then uses
   the victim's authorization to gain access to the information
   unknowingly authorized by the victim.

   In this attack, the attacker is using a known client application
   (consumer site), and a target OAuth resource provider.  The attack
   depends on the victim expecting the consumer site to request access
   to the resource provider.

   The attacker utilizes the following flow:

   The attacker initiates browser access to the consumer site, and
   initates access to data from the resource provider.  The consumer
   site, initiates an authorization request and receives a redirect_uri
   back from the resource provider's authorization server.  Instead of
   following the link, the attacker stops the process and saves the
   redirect_uri.  The attacker modifies the redirect_uri to allow
   control to be returned to the attacker site.

   The attacker tricks another user (the victim) to open that
   redirect_uri and to authorize access (e.g. an email link, or blog
   link).  The way the attacker achieve that goal is out of scope.

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft             OAuth 2.0 Security                 March 2011</span>


   Having clicked, the link, the victim is requested to authenticate and
   authorize the consumer site to have access.

   The authorization server redirects the user agent to the attackers
   web site instead of the original target web site.

   The attacker obtains the authorization code from its web site,
   constructs a redirect_uri to the target web site (or app) based on
   the original authorization request's redirect_uri and the newly
   obtained authorization code and directs its user agent to this URL.

   The web uses the authorization code to fetch a token from the
   authorization server and associates this token with the attacker's
   user account on this site.

   Countermeasures:

   o  The attacker must use another redirect_uri for its authorization
      process than the target web site because it needs to intercept the
      flow.  So if the authorization server associates the authorization
      code with the redirect_uri of a particular end-user authorization,
      such a change (and with that such an attack) can be detected - see
      <a href="#section-5.2.4.4">Section 5.2.4.4</a>

   o  The authorization server may also enforce the usage and validation
      of pre-registered redirect Uris (see <a href="#section-5.2.3.5">Section 5.2.3.5</a>).

   o  For native apps, one could also consider to use deployment-
      specific client ids and secrets (see <a href="#section-5.2.3.4">Section 5.2.3.4</a>, along with
      the binding of authorization code to client_id (see
      <a href="#section-5.2.4.4">Section 5.2.4.4</a>), to detect a session fixation because the
      attacker does not have access the deployment-specific secret.
      Thus he will not be able to exchange the authorization code.

   o  The client may consider to use other flows, which are not
      vulnerable to session fixation attacks (see <a href="#section-4.4.2">Section 4.4.2</a> or
      <a href="#section-4.4.3">Section 4.4.3</a>).

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.4.1.8" href="#section-4.4.1.8">4.4.1.8</a>.  Threat: DoS, Exhaustion of resources attacks</span>

   If a Service Provider includes a nontrivial amount of entropy in
   authorization codes or access tokens (limiting the number of possible
   codes/tokens) and automatically grants either without user
   intervention and has no limit on code or access tokens per user, an
   attacker could exhaust the pool by repeatedly directing user(s)
   browser to request code or access tokens.  This is because more
   entropy means a larger number of tokens can be issued.

   Countermeasures:

   o  The service provider should consider limiting the number of access
      tokens granted per user.  The service provider should include a
      nontrivial amount of entropy in authorization codes.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.4.2.1" href="#section-4.4.2.1">4.4.2.1</a>.  Threat: Access token leak in transport/end-points</span>

   Description: the access token is directly returned to the client as
   part of the redirect URL.  This token might be eavesdropped by an
   attacker.  The token is sent from server to client via a URI fragment
   of the redirect_uri.  If the communication is not secured or the end-
   point is not secured, the token could be leaked by parsing the
   returned URI.  Impact: the attacker would be able to assume the same
   rights granted by the token.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Confidentiality of Requests - <a href="#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1</a>

   o  Bind token to client id - <a href="#section-5.1.5.8">Section 5.1.5.8</a>

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.4.2.2" href="#section-4.4.2.2">4.4.2.2</a>.  Threat: Access token leak in browser history</span>

   An attacker could obtain the token from the browsers history.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Shorten token duration (see <a href="#section-5.1.5.3">Section 5.1.5.3</a>) and reduced scope of
      the token may reduce the impact of that attack (see
      <a href="#section-5.1.5.1">Section 5.1.5.1</a>).

   o  Make these requests non-cachable

   o  Native apps can directly embedd a browser widget and therewith
      gain full control of the cache.  So the app can cleanup browser
      history after authorization process.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.4.2.3" href="#section-4.4.2.3">4.4.2.3</a>.  Threat: Malicious client obtains authorization</span>

   An malicious client could attempt to obtain a token by fraud.  Client
   secrets are not an effective countermeasure in this case.

   The following countermeasures are advisable:





<span class="grey">Lodderstedt, et al.    Expires September 15, 2011              [Page 26]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-27" id="page-27" href="#page-27" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey">Internet-Draft             OAuth 2.0 Security                 March 2011</span>


   o  Always require user consent and let end-user validate client
      identity - <a href="#section-5.2.4.3">Section 5.2.4.3</a>

   o  No automatic processing of repeated authorizations -
      <a href="#section-5.2.4.1">Section 5.2.4.1</a>

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.4.3" href="#section-4.4.3">4.4.3</a>.  Resource Owner Password Credentials</span>

   The "password" grant type (see OAuth Core <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>), often used
   for legacy/migration reasons, allows a client to request an access
   token using an end-users user-id and password along with its own
   credential.  The "password" grant-type has higher risk because it
   maintains the uid/password anti-pattern.  Additionally, because the
   user does not have control over the authorization process, clients
   using this grant-type are not limited by scope, but instead have
   potentially the same capabilities as the user themselves.  As there
   is no authorization step, the ability to offer token revocation is
   bypassed.

   Impact: The resource server can only differentiate scope based on the
   access token being associated with a particular client.  The client
   could also acquire long-living tokens and pass them up to a attacker
   web service for further abuse.  The client, eavesdroppers, or end-
   points could eavesdrop user id and password.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Except for migration reasons, minimize use of this grant type

   o  The authorization server must validate the client id associated
      with the particular refresh token with every refresh request -
      <a href="#section-5.2.2.2">Section 5.2.2.2</a>

   o  Service Providers MUST ensure that these transmissions are
      protected using transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS or SSL (see
      <a href="#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1</a>).

   If an authorization server does not provide enough protection, an
   attacker or disgruntled employee could retrieve the passwords for a
   client

   Countermeasures:

   o  Use other flows, which do not rely on the client's cooperation for
      secure resource owner credential handling

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.4.3.2" href="#section-4.4.3.2">4.4.3.2</a>.  Threat: Client obtains scopes without end-user authorization</span>

   All interaction with the resource owner is performed by the client.
   Thus it might, intentionally or unintentionally, happen that the
   client obtains a token with scope unknown for or unintended by the
   resource owner.  For example, the resource owner might think the
   client needs and acquires read-only access to its media storage only
   but the client tries to acquire an access token with full access
   permissions.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Use other flows, which do not rely on the client's cooperation for
      resource owner interaction

   o  The authorization server may generally restrict the scope of
      access tokens (<a href="#section-5.1.5.1">Section 5.1.5.1</a>) issued by this flow.  If the
      particular client is trustworthy and can be authenticated in a
      reliable way, the authorization server could relax that
      restriction.  Resource owners may prescribe (e.g. in their
      preferences) what the maximum permission for client using this
      flow shall be.

   o  The authorization server could notify the resource owner by an
      appropriate media, e.g. e-Mail, of the grant issued (see
      <a href="#section-5.1.3">Section 5.1.3</a>).

   All interaction with the resource owner is performed by the client.
   Thus it might, intentionally or unintentionally, happen that the
   client obtains a long-term authorization represented by a refresh
   token even if the resource owner did not intend so.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Use other flows, which do not rely on the client's cooperation for
      resource owner interaction

   o  The authorization server may generally refuse to issue refresh
      tokens in this flow (see <a href="#section-5.2.2.1">Section 5.2.2.1</a>).  If the particular

      (cf. client authentication), the authorization server could relax
      that restriction.  Resource owners may allow or deny (e.g. in

   requests to the authorization server.  Given the assumption that the
   authorization server URL is well-known at development time or can at
   least be obtained from a well-known resource server, the attacker
   must utilize some kind of spoofing in order to suceed.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Server authentication (as described in <a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a>)

   An attacker could try to obtain a valid access token on transport
   between client and resource server.  As access tokens are shared
   secrets between authorization and resource server, they MUST by
   treated with the same care as other credentials (e.g. end-user
   passwords).

   o  A short lifetime reduces impact in case tokens are compromised
      (see <a href="#section-5.1.5.3">Section 5.1.5.3</a>).

   o  The access token can be bound to a client's identity and require
      the client to authenticate with the resource server (see
      <a href="#section-5.4.2">Section 5.4.2</a>).  Client authentication MUST be performed without

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.6.2" href="#section-4.6.2">4.6.2</a>.  Threat: Replay authorized resource server requests</span>

   An attacker could attempt to replay valid requests in order to obtain
   or to modify/destroy user data.

   Countermeasures:

   o  The resource server should utilize transport security measure in
      order to prevent such attacks (see <a href="#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1</a>).  This would
      prevent the attacker from capturing valid requests.

   o  Alternatively, the resource server could employ signed requests
      (see <a href="#section-5.4.3">Section 5.4.3</a>) along with nounces and timestamps in order to
      uniquely identify requests.  The resource server MUST detect and
      refuse every replayed request.

   Where the token is a handle, the attacker may use attempt to guess
   the access token values based on knowledge they have from other
   access tokens.

   Impact: Access to a single user's data.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Handle Tokens should have a reasonable entropy (see
      <a href="#section-5.1.5.11">Section 5.1.5.11</a>) in order to make guessing a valid token value
      difficult.

   o  Assertion (or self-contained token ) tokens contents SHALL be
      protected by a digital signature (see <a href="#section-5.1.5.9">Section 5.1.5.9</a>).

   o  Security can be further strengthened by using a short access token

   server in turn may use that token to access other services on behalf
   of the resource owner.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Clients SHOULD not make authenticated requests with an access
      token to unfamiliar resource servers, regardless of the presence
      of a secure channel.  If the resource server address is well-known
      to the client, it may authenticate the resource servers (see
      <a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a>).

   o  Associate the endpoint address of the resource server the client
      talked to with the access token (e.g. in an audience field) and
      validate association at legitimate resource server.  The endpoint
      address validation policy may be strict (exact match) or more
      relaxed (e.g. same host).  This would require to tell the
      authorization server the resource server endpoint address in the
      authorization process.

   o  Associate an access token with a client and authenticate the
      client with resource server requests (typically via signature in
      order to not disclose secret to a potential attacker).  This
      prevents the attack because the counterfeit server is assumed to
      miss the capabilities to correctly authenticate on behalf of the
      legitimate client to the resource server (<a href="#section-5.4.2">Section 5.4.2</a>).

   o  Restrict the token scope (see <a href="#section-5.1.5.1">Section 5.1.5.1</a>) and or limit the
      token to a certain resource server (<a href="#section-5.1.5.5">Section 5.1.5.5</a>).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.6.5" href="#section-4.6.5">4.6.5</a>.  Threat: Abuse of token by legitimate resource server or client</span>

   A legitimate resource server could attempt to use an access token to
   access another resource servers.  Similarily, a client could try to
   use a token obtained for one server on another resource server.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Tokens should be restricted to particular resource servers (see
      <a href="#section-5.1.5.5">Section 5.1.5.5</a>).

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.6.6" href="#section-4.6.6">4.6.6</a>.  Threat: Leak of confidential data in HTTP-Proxies</span>

   The HTTP Authorization scheme (OAuth HTTP Authorization Scheme) is
   optional.  However, [<a href="./rfc2616">RFC2616</a>](Fielding, R., Gettys, J., Mogul, J.,
   Frystyk, H., Masinter, L., Leach, P., and T. Berners-Lee, "Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1," .) relies on the Authorization and
   WWW-Authenticate headers to distinguish authenticated content so that
   it can be protected.  Proxies and caches, in particular, may fail to
   adequately protect requests not using these headers.  For example,
   private authenticated content may be stored in (and thus retrievable
   from) publicly-accessible caches.

   CounterMeasures:

   o  Service Providers not using the HTTP Authorization scheme (OAuth
      HTTP Authorization Scheme - see <a href="#section-5.4.1">Section 5.4.1</a>) should take care to
      use other mechanisms, such as the Cache-Control header, to ensure
      that authenticated content is protected.

   o  Reducing scope (see <a href="#section-5.1.5.1">Section 5.1.5.1</a>) and expiry time
      (<a href="#section-5.1.5.3">Section 5.1.5.3</a>) for access tokens can be used to reduce the
      damage in case of leaks.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.6.7" href="#section-4.6.7">4.6.7</a>.  Threat: Token leakage via logfiles and HTTP referrers</span>

   If access tokens are sent via URI query parameters, such tokens may
   leak to log files and HTTP referrers.

   Countermeasures:

   o  Use authorization headers or POST parameters instead of URI
      request parameters (see <a href="#section-5.4.1">Section 5.4.1</a>).

   o  Set logging configuration appropriately

   o  Prevent unauthorized persons from access to system log files (see
      <a href="#section-5.1.4.1.1">Section 5.1.4.1.1</a>)

   o  HTTP referrers can be prevented by reloading the target page again
      without URI parameters

   o  Abuse of leaked access tokens can be prevented by enforcing
      authenticated requests (see <a href="#section-5.4.2">Section 5.4.2</a>).

   o  The impact of token leakage may be reduced by limiting scope (see
      <a href="#section-5.1.5.1">Section 5.1.5.1</a>) and duration (see <a href="#section-5.1.5.3">Section 5.1.5.3</a>) and enforcing

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This section describes the countermeasures as recommended to mitigate
   the threats as described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  General</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.1" href="#section-5.1.1">5.1.1</a>.  Confidentiality of Requests</span>

   This is applicable to all requests sent from client to authorization
   server or resource server.  While OAuth provides a mechanism for
   verifying the integrity of requests, it provides no guarantee of
   request confidentiality.  Unless further precautions are taken,
   eavesdroppers will have full access to request content and may be
   able to mount attacks through using content of request, e.g. secrets
   or tokens, or mount replay attacks.

   Attacks can be mitigated by using transport-layer mechanisms such as
   TLS or SSL.  VPN may considered as well.

   This is a countermeasure against the following threats:

   o  Replay of access tokens obtained on tokens endpoint or resource
      server's endpoint

   o  Replay of refresh tokens obtained on tokens endpoint

   o  Replay of authorization codes obtained on tokens endpoint
      (redirect?)

   o  Replay of user passwords and client secrets

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.2" href="#section-5.1.2">5.1.2</a>.  Server authentication</span>

   HTTPS server authentication or similar means can be used to
   authenticate the identity of a server.  The goal is to reliably bind
   the DNS name of the server to the public key presented by the server
   during connection establishment.

   The client MUST validate the binding of the server to its domain
   name.  If the server fails to prove that binding, it is condered a
   men-in-the-middle.  The security measure depends on the certification
   authorities the client trusts for that purpose.  Clients should
   carefully select those trusted CAs and protect the storage for
   trusted CA certificates from modifications.

   This is a countermeasure against the following threats:

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.3" href="#section-5.1.3">5.1.3</a>.  Always keep the resource owner informed</span>

   Transparency to the resource owner is a key element of the OAuth
   protocol.  The user shall always be in control of the authorization
   processes and get the necessary information to meet informed
   decisions.  Moreover, user involvement is a further security
   countermeasure.  The user can probably recognize certain kinds of
   attacks better than the authorization server.  Information can be
   presented/exchanged during the authorization process, after the
   authorization process, and every time the user wishes to get informed
   by using techniques such as:

   o  User consent forms

   o  Notification messages (e-Mail, SMS, ...)

   o  Activity/Event logs

   o  User self-care apps or portals

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.4" href="#section-5.1.4">5.1.4</a>.  Credentials</span>

   This sections describes countermeasures used to protect all kind of
   credentials from unauthorized access and abuse.  Credentials are long
   term secrets, such as client secrets and user passwords as well as
   all kinds of tokens (refresh and access token) or authorization
   codes.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.4.1.3" href="#section-5.1.4.1.3">5.1.4.1.3</a>.  No cleartext storage of credentials</span>

   The authorization server may consider to not store credential in
   clear text.  Typical approaches are to store hashes instead.  If the
   credential lacks a reasonable entropy level (because it is a user
   password) an additional salt will harden the storage to prevent
   offline dictionary attacks.  Note: Some authentication protocols
   require the authorization server to have access to the secret in the
   clear.  Those protocols cannot be implemented if the server only has
   access to hashes.

   Usage of asymmetric cryptography will free the authorization server
   of the obligation to manage credentials.  Nevertheless, it MUST
   ensure the integrity of the respective public keys.

   The authorization server may decide to enforce a complex user
   password policy in order to increase the user passwords' entropy.
   This will hinder online password attacks.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.4.2.2" href="#section-5.1.4.2.2">5.1.4.2.2</a>.  High entropy of secrets</span>

   When creating token handles or other secrets not intended for usage
   by human users, the authorization server MUST include a reasonable
   level of entropy in order to mitigate the risk of guessing attacks.

   The token value MUST be constructed from a cryptographically strong
   random or pseudo-random number sequence [<a href="./rfc1750">RFC1750</a>] generated by the
   Authorization Server.  The probability of any two Authorization Code
   values being identical MUST be less than or equal to 2^(-128) and
   SHOULD be less than or equal to 2^(-160).

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.4.2.3" href="#section-5.1.4.2.3">5.1.4.2.3</a>.  Lock accounts</span>

   Online attacks on passwords can be mitigated by locking the
   respective accounts after a certain number of failed attempts.

   Note: This measure can be abused to lock down legitimate service
   users.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.4.2.4" href="#section-5.1.4.2.4">5.1.4.2.4</a>.  Tar pit</span>

   The authorization server may react on failed attempts to authenticate
   by username/password by temporarily locking the respective account
   and delaying the response for a certain duration.  This duration may
   increase with the number of failed attempts.  The objective is to
   slow the attackes attempts on a certain username down.

   Note: this may require a more complex and stateful design of the
   authorization server.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.4.2.5" href="#section-5.1.4.2.5">5.1.4.2.5</a>.  Usage of CAPTCHAs</span>

   The idea is to prevent programms from automatically checkinga huge
   number of passwords by requiring human interaction.

   Note: this has a negative impact on user experience.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.5" href="#section-5.1.5">5.1.5</a>.  Tokens (access, refresh, code)</span>

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.5.1" href="#section-5.1.5.1">5.1.5.1</a>.  Limit token scope</span>

   The authorization server may decide to reduce or limit the scope
   associated with a token.  Basis of this decision is out of scope,
   examples are:

   o  a client-specific policy, e.g. issue only less powerful tokens to
      unauthenticated clients,

   o  a service-specific policy, e.g. it a very sensible service,

   o  a resource-owner specific setting, or

   o  combinations of such policies and preferences.

   The authorization server may allow different scopes dependent on the
   grant type.  For example, end-user authorization via direct
   interaction with the end-user (authorization code) might be
   considered more reliable than direct authorization via gran type
   username/password.  This means will reduce the impact of the
   following threats:

   o  token leakage

   o  token issuance to malicious software

   o  unintended issuance of to powerful tokens with resource owner
      credentials flow

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.5.2" href="#section-5.1.5.2">5.1.5.2</a>.  Expiration time</span>

   Tokens should generally expire after a reasonable duration.  This
   complements and strengthens other security measures (such as
   signatures) and reduces the impact of all kinds of token leaks.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.5.3" href="#section-5.1.5.3">5.1.5.3</a>.  Short expiration time</span>

   A short expiration time for tokens is a protection means against the
   following threats:

   o  replay

   o  reduce impact of token leak

   o  reduce likelyhood of sucessful online guessing

   Note: Short token duration requires preciser clock synchronisation
   between authorization server and resource server.  Furthermore,
   shorter duration may require more token refreshments (access token)
   or repeated end-user authorization processes (authorization code and
   refresh token).

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.5.4" href="#section-5.1.5.4">5.1.5.4</a>.  Limit number of usages/ One time usage</span>

   The authorization server may restrict the number of request, which
   can be performed with a certain token.  This mechanism can be used to
   mitigate the following threats:

   o  replay of tokens

   o  reduce likelyhood of sucessful online guessing

   Additionally, If an Authorization Server observes multiple attempts
   to redeem a authorization code, the Authorization Server may want to
   revoke all tokens granted based on the authorization code.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.5.5" href="#section-5.1.5.5">5.1.5.5</a>.  Bind tokens to a particular resource server (Audience)</span>

   Authorization servers in multi-service environments may consider to
   issue tokens with different content to different resource servers and
   to explicitely indicate in the token the target server a token is
   intended to be sent to (cf. Audience in SAML Assertions).  This
   countermeasure can be used in the following situations:

   o  It reduce the impact of a successful replay attempt, since the
      token is applicable to a single resource server, only.

   o  It prevents abuse of a token by a rough resource server or client,
      since the token can only be used on that server.  It is rejected
      by other servers.

   o  It reduce the impact of a leakage of a valid token to a conterfeit
      resource server.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.5.6" href="#section-5.1.5.6">5.1.5.6</a>.  Use endpoint address as token audience</span>

   This may be used to indicate to a resource server, which endpoint
   address has been used to obtain the token.  This measure will allow
   to detect requests from a counterfeit resource server, since such
   token will contain the endpoint address of that server.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.5.7" href="#section-5.1.5.7">5.1.5.7</a>.  Audience and Token scopes</span>

   Deployments may consider to use only tokens with explicitely defined
   scope, where every scope is associated with a particular resource
   server.  This approach can be used to mitigate attacks, where a
   resource server or client uses a token for a different then the
   intended purpose.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1.5.8" href="#section-5.1.5.8">5.1.5.8</a>.  Bind token to client id</span>

   An authorization server may bind a token to a certain client
   identity.  This identity match must be validated for every request
   with that token.  This means can be used, to

   o  detect token leakage and

   o  prevent token abuse.

   Note: Validating the client identity may require the target server to
   authenticate the client's identity.  This authentication can be based
   on secrets managed independent of the token (e.g. pre-registered
   client id/secret on authorization server) or sent with the token
   itself (e.g. as part of the encrypted token content).

   The authorization server may decide based on an appropriate policy
   not to issue refresh tokens.  Since refresh tokens areo long term
   credentials, they may be subject theft.  For example, if the
   authorization server does not trust a client to securely store such
   tokens, it may refuse to issue such a client a refresh token.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2.2.2" href="#section-5.2.2.2">5.2.2.2</a>.  Binding of refresh token to client_id</span>

   The authorization server MUST bind every refresh token to the id of
   the client such a token was originally issued to and validate this
   binding for every request to refresh that token.  This measure is a
   countermeasure against refresh token theft or leakage.

   Note: This binding MUST be protected from unauthorized modifications.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2.2.3" href="#section-5.2.2.3">5.2.2.3</a>.  Refresh Token Replacement</span>

   Refresh token replacement is intended to automatically detect and
   prevent attempts to use the same refresh token in parallel from
   different apps/devices.  This happens if a token gets stolen from the
   client and is subsequently used by the attacker and the legitimate
   client.  The basic idea is to change the refresh token value with
   every refresh request in order to detect attempts to obtain access
   tokens using old refresh tokens.  Since the authorization server
   cannot determine whether the attacker or the legitimate client is
   trying to access, in case of such an access attempt the valid refresh
   token and the access authorization associated with it are both
   revoked.

   The OAuth specification supports this measure in that the tokens
   response allows the authorization server to return a new refresh
   token even for requests with grant type "refresh_token".

   Note: this measure may cause problems in clustered environments since
   usage of the currently valid refresh token must be ensured.  In such
   an environment, other measures might be more appropriate.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2.2.4" href="#section-5.2.2.4">5.2.2.4</a>.  Refresh Token Revocation</span>

   The authorization server may allow clients or end-users to
   explicitely request the invalidation of refresh tokens.

   This is a countermeasure againts:

   o  device theft

   o  ...

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2.2.5" href="#section-5.2.2.5">5.2.2.5</a>.  Combine refresh token requests with user-provided secret</span>

   The exchange of a refresh token can be bound to the presence of a
   certain user-provided secret, such as a PIN, a password or a SIM

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2.3" href="#section-5.2.3">5.2.3</a>.  Client authentication and authorization</span>

   As described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> (Security Features), clients are
   identified, authenticated and authorized for several purposes, such
   as a

   o  Collate sub-sequent requests to the same client,

   o  Indicate the trustworthiness of a particular client to the end-
      user,

   o  Authorize access of clients to certain features on the
      authorization or resource server, and

   o  Log a client identity to log files for analysis or statics.

   Due to the different capababilities and characterictics of the
   different client types, there are different ways to support achieve
   objectives, which will be described in this section.  Generally
   spoken, authorization server providers should be aware of the
   security policy and deployment of a particular clients and adapt its
   treatment accordingly.  For example, one approach could be to treat
   all clients as less trustworthy and unsecure.  On the other extrem, a
   service provider could activate every client installation by hand of
   an administrator and that way gain confidence in the identity of the
   software package and the security of the environment the client is
   installed in.  And there are several approaches in between.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2.3.1" href="#section-5.2.3.1">5.2.3.1</a>.  Don't issue secrets to clients with inappropriate security</span>
          policy

   Authorization servers should not issue secrets to clients, if these
   cannot sufficiently protect it.  This prevents the server from
   overestimating the value of a sucessful authentication of the client.

   For example, it is of limited benefit to create a single client id
   and secret which is shared by all installations of a native app.
   First of all, this secret must be somehow transmitted from the
   developer via the respective distribution channel, e.g. an app
   market, to all installations of the app on end-user devices.  So the



<span class="grey">Lodderstedt, et al.    Expires September 15, 2011              [Page 43]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-44" id="page-44" href="#page-44" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey">Internet-Draft             OAuth 2.0 Security                 March 2011</span>


   secret is typically burned into the source code of the app or a
   associated resource bundle, which cannot be entirely protected from
   reverse engineering.  Second, effectively such secrets cannot be
   revoked since this would immediatly put all installations out of
   work.  Moreover, since the authorization server cannot really trust
   on the client's identity, it would be dangerous to indicate to end-
   users the trustworthiness of the client.

   There are other ways to achieve a reasonable security level, as
   described in the following sections.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2.3.2" href="#section-5.2.3.2">5.2.3.2</a>.  Client_id only in combination with forced user consent</span>

   The authorization may issue a client id, but only accept
   authorization request, which are approved by the end-user.  This
   measure precludes automatic authorization processes.  This is a
   countermeasure for clients without secret against the following
   threats:

   o  ...

   o  ...

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2.3.3" href="#section-5.2.3.3">5.2.3.3</a>.  Client_id only in combination with redirect_uri</span>

   The authorization may issue a client id, but bind this client_id to a
   certain pre-configured redirect_uri.  So any authorization request
   with another redirect_uri is refused automatically.  Alternatively,
   the authorization server may not accept any dynamic redirect_uri for
   such a client_id and instead always redirect to the well-known pre-
   configured redirect_uri.  This is a countermeasure for clients of LOA
   2 against the following threats:

   o  ...

   o  ...

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2.3.4" href="#section-5.2.3.4">5.2.3.4</a>.  Deployment-specific client secrets</span>

   A authorization server may issue separate client ids and
   corresponding secrets to the different deployments of a client.

   For web applications, this could mean to create one client_id and
   client_secret per web site a software package is installed on.  So
   the provider of that particular site could request client id and
   secret from the authorization server during setup of the web site.
   This would also allow to validate some of the properties of that web
   site, such as redirect_uri, address, and whatever proofs useful.  The



<span class="grey">Lodderstedt, et al.    Expires September 15, 2011              [Page 44]</span>

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft             OAuth 2.0 Security                 March 2011</span>


   web site provider has to ensure the security of the client secret on
   the site.  As a result, such client could reach LOA 7.

   For native applications, things are more complicated because every
   installation of the app on any device is another deployment.
   Deployment specific secrets will require

   1.  Either to obtain a client_id and client_secret during download
       process from the app market, or

   2.  During installation on the device.

   Either approach will require an automated mechanism for issuing
   client ids and secrets, which is currently not defined by OAuth.

   The first approach would allow to achieve LOA 7, whereas the second
   option does not allow to validate properties of the client thus can
   achieve at most LOA 6.  But this would at least help to prevent
   several replay attacks.  Moreover, deployment-specific client_id and
   secret allow to selectively revoke all refresh tokens of a specific
   deployment at once.  This is a countermeasure against the following
   threats:

   o  ...

   o  ...

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2.3.5" href="#section-5.2.3.5">5.2.3.5</a>.  Validation of pre-registered redirect_uri</span>

   An authorization server may require clients to register their
   redirect_uri or a pattern (TBD: make definition more precise)
   thereof.  The way this registration is performed is out of scope of
   this document.  Every actual redirect_uri sent with the respective
   client_id to the end-user authorization endpoint must comply with
   that pattern.  Otherwise the authorization server must assume the
   inbound GET request has been sent by an attacker and refuse it.

   Note: the authorization server MUST NOT redirect the user agent back
   to the redirect_uri of the authorization request.

   o  Session fixation: allows to detect session fixation attempts
      already after first redirect to end-user authorization endpoint

   o  For clients of LOA 2/5/7, this measure also helps to detect
      malicious apps early in the end-user authorization process.  This
      reduces the need for a interactive validation by the user.

   The underlying assumption of this measure is that an attacker must

   use another redirect_uri in order to get access to the authorization
   code.  Deployments might consider the possibility of an attacker
   using spoofing attacks to a victims device to circumvent this
   security measure.  This is a countermeasure against the following
   threats:

   o  session fixation

   o  malicious apps (for deployment-specific clients with secret)

   Note: Pre-registering clients might not scale in some deployments
   (manual process) or require dynamic client registration (not
   specified yet).  With the lack of dynamic client registration, it
   only works for clients bound to certain deployments at development/
   configuration time.  As soon as dynamic resource server discovery
   gets involved, that's no longer feasable.

   known to the authorization server fits the name of the web site or

   The are different way to store secrets of all kinds (tokens, client
   secrets) securely on a device or server.

   Most multi-user operation systems seggregate the personal storage of
   the different system users.  Moreover, most modern smartphone
   operating systems even support to store app-specific data in separat
   areas of the file systems and protect it from access by other apps.
   Additionally, apps can implements confidential data itself using a
   user-supplied secret, such as PIN or password.

   Another option is to swap refresh token storage to a trusted backend
   server.  This mean in turn requires a resilient authentication
   mechanisms between client and backend server.  Note: Applications
   must ensure that confidential data are kept confidential even after
   readin from secure storage, which typically means to keep this data
   in the local memory of the app.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.4.1" href="#section-5.4.1">5.4.1</a>.  Authorization headers</span>

   Authorization headers are recognized and specially treated by HTTP
   proxies and servers.  Thus the usage of such headers for sending
   access tokens to resource servers reduces the likelihood of leakage
   or unintended storage of authenticated requests in general and
   especially Authorization headers.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.4.2" href="#section-5.4.2">5.4.2</a>.  Authenticated requests</span>

   An authorization server may bind tokens to a certain client identitiy
   and encourage resource servers to validate that binding.  This will
   require the resource server to authenticate the originator of a
   request as the legitimate owner of a particular token.  There are a
   couple of options to implement this countermeasure:

   o  The authorization server may associate the distinguished name of
      the client with the token (either internally or in the payload of
      an self-contained token).  The client then uses client
      certificate-based HTTP authentication on the resource server's
      endpoint to authenticate its identity and the resource server
      validates the name with the name referenced by the token.

   o  same as before, but the client uses his private key to sign the
      request to the resource server (public key is either contained in
      the token or sent along with the request)

   o  Alternatively, the authorization server may issue a token-bound
      secret, which the client uses to sign the request.  The resource
      server obtains the secret either directly from the authorization
      server or it is contained in an encrypted section of the token.
      That way the resource server does not "know" the client but is
      able to validate whether the authorization server issued the token
      to that client

   This mechanisms is a countermeasure against abuse of tokens by
   counterfeit resource servers.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.4.3" href="#section-5.4.3">5.4.3</a>.  Signed requests</span>

   A resource server may decide to accept signed requests only, either
   to replace transport level security measures or to complement such
   measures.  Every signed request must be uniquly identifiable and must
   not be processed twice by the resource server.  This countermeasure
   helps to mitigate:
