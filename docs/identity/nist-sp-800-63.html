<p>This section covers the mechanical authentication process of a claimant who already has registered a token.
Identity proofing and registration are dealt with separately in Section 7.
The authentication process shall provide sufficient information to the relying party
to uniquely identify the registration information
provided by the subscriber and verified by the <em class="xref std std-term">RA</em> in the issuance of the credential.</p>
<p>Four assurance levels are defined, numbered 1 to 4.
Level 4 provides the highest level of authentication assurance,
while Level 1 provides the least assurance.
The technical requirements for authentication mechanisms (tokens, protocols and security protections) are stated in this section.</p>
<div class="section" id="level-1">
<span id="nist-sp-800-63-8-2-1"></span><h3>8.2.1. Level 1<a class="headerlink" href="#level-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although there is no identity proofing requirement at this level,
the authentication mechanism provides some assurance that the same claimant is accessing the protected transaction or data.
It allows a wide range of available authentication technologies to be employed
and permits the use of any token methods of Levels 2, 3 or 4.</p>
<p>Successful authentication requires that the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-claimant"><em class="xref std std-term">claimant</em></a>  shall prove,
through a secure authentication protocol, that he/she controls the token.</p>
<p>Plaintext passwords or secrets shall not be transmitted across a network at Level 1.
However this level does not require cryptographic methods that block offline analysis by eavesdroppers.</p>
<p>For example, password challenge-response protocols
that combine a password with a challenge to generate an authentication reply satisfy this requirement
although an eavesdropper who intercepts the challenge
and reply may be able to conduct a successful off-line dictionary or password exhaustion attack
and recover the password.</p>
<p>Common protocols that meet Level 1 requirements include APOP [RFC 1939], S/KEY [SKEY], and Kerberos [KERB].
Since an eavesdropper who intercepts such a protocol exchange will often be able to find
the password with a straightforward dictionary attack,
and this vulnerability is independent of the strength of the operations,
there is no requirement at this level to use Approved cryptographic techniques.</p>
<p>At Level 1, long-term shared authentication secrets may be revealed to verifiers.</p>

<span id="nist-sp-800-63-8-2-3"></span><h3>8.2.3. Level 3<a class="headerlink" href="#level-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Level 3 authentication is based on proof of possession of a cryptographic key using a cryptographic protocol.
Level 3 authentication assurance requires cryptographic strength mechanisms that protect the primary authentication token
(a secret key or a private key) against compromise by the following protocol threats defined in <em class="xref std std-ref">section 8.1.1</em>:
eavesdropper, replay, on-line guessing, verifier impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
<p>Level 3 also requires <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-two-factor-authentication"><em class="xref std std-term">two factor authentication</em></a> ; in addition to the key,
the user must employ a password or biometric to activate the key.</p>
<p>Three kinds of tokens described below may be used to meet Level 3 requirements:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Soft cryptographic token:
a cryptographic key stored on a general-purpose computer.
Hardware tokens validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 1 or higher may also be used to hold the key
and perform cryptographic operations.
The claimant shall be required to activate the key before using it with a password or biometric, or,
alternatively shall use a password as well as the key in an authentication protocol with the verifier.
If a password is employed to unlock the soft token key,
the key shall be kept encrypted under a key derived from a password meeting the requirements for Level 2 authentication,
and decrypted only for actual use in authentication.
Alternatively, if a password protocol is employed with the verifier,
the use of the password shall meet the requirements for Level 2 authentication assurance.</p>
<p>Hard token:
a cryptographic key stored on a special hardware device.
Tokens must be validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 1 or higher overall.
The claimant shall be required to activate the key before using it with a password or biometric,
or, alternatively, shall use a password as well as the key in an authentication protocol with the verifier.
The authentication mechanism used to authenticate the claimant to unlock token shall be validated
as meeting the operator authentication requirements for FIPS 140-2 Level 2.
Alternatively, if a password protocol is employed with a verifier,
the use of the password shall meet the requirements for Level 1 authentication assurance.</p>
<p>One-time password device tokens:
the authentication depends on a symmetric key stored on a personal hardware device
that is a cryptographic module validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 1 or higher overall.
The device combines a nonce with a cryptographic key to produce an output
that is sent to the verifier as a password.
The password shall be used only once and is cryptographically generated;
therefore it needs no additional eavesdropper protection.
The one-time password output by the device shall have at least 106 possible values.
The verifier must be authenticated cryptographically to the claimant,
for example using a TLS server.
To protect against the use of a stolen token, one of the following measures shall be used:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The authentication mechanism used to authenticate the claimant to the token
shall be validated as meeting the operator authentication requirements for FIPS 140-2 Level 2.</li>
<li>The claimant sends the verifier a personal password meeting the requirements for (E-authentication) Level 1
with the one-time password.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Authentication requires that the claimant shall prove through a secure authentication protocol that he or she controls the token. Long-term shared authentication secrets, if used, shall never be revealed to any party except the claimant and CSP, however session (temporary) shared secrets may be provided to verifiers by the CSP. Approved cryptographic techniques shall be used for all operations.</p>
<p>Each of the three token types has somewhat different utility and security properties. Soft token solutions are easily realized in “thin clients” with TLS and client certificates. Moreover this solution allows not only initial authentication of claimants, but also allows the entire session, or as much of it as is security critical, to be cryptographically authenticated by a key created during the authentication process. Hard token solutions provide the additional assurance of a physical token, and users should know if their token has been stolen. Like soft tokens, hard tokens allow not only initial authentication of claimants, but also allows the entire session, or as much of it as is security critical, to be cryptographically authenticated by a key created during the authentication process. One- time password device token systems are commercially available, portable and work easily with any browser client. Like hard tokens, one-time password device tokens have the security advantage that the token is a tangible, physical object. Subscribers should know if their token is stolen, and the key is not vulnerable to network, shoulder-surfing or keyboard sniffer attacks. Unlike soft tokens or hard tokens, a session key is not created from the authentication process to authenticate subsequent data transfers.</p>
<p>All three token types present the eavesdroppers with similar strong cryptographic protection.   Each has its advantages and disadvantages against various types of attacks. All three offer considerably greater strength than Level 2 solutions. Application implementers with specific Level 3 authentication requirements, who need to select a particular technology should chose the one that best suits the functional needs and risks of their application.</p>

<h4>8.2.3.1. Credential/Token Lifetime, Status or Revocation<a class="headerlink" href="#credential-token-lifetime-status-or-revocation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>CSPs shall provide a secure mechanism to allow verifiers or relying parties to ensure that the credentials are valid. Such mechanisms may include: revocation lists, on-line validation servers, and the use of credentials with short life-times or the involvement of CSP servers that have access to status records in authentication transactions. Shared secret based authentication systems may simply remove revoked subscribers from the verification database. Verifiers shall check to ensure that the credentials they use are valid.
CSPs shall have a procedure to revoke credentials and tokens within 24 hours.

<h4>8.2.3.3.Protection of Long-term Shared Secrets<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Files of long-term shared secrets used by CSPs or verifiers at Level 3 shall be protected by discretionary access controls that limit access to administrators and only those applications that require access. Such shared secret files shall be encrypted so that:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The encryption key for the shared secret file is encrypted under a key held in a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher validated hardware cryptographic module or any FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or 4 cryptographic module and decrypted only as immediately required for an authentication operation.</li>
<li>Shared secrets are protected as a key within the boundary of a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher validated hardware cryptographic module or any FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or 4 cryptographic module and is not exported in plaintext from the module.</li>
<li>Shared secrets are split by a cryptographic secret sharing method between m separate verifier systems, so that the cooperation of n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ m) systems in a secure protocol is required to perform the authentication and an attacker who learns n-1 of the secret shares, learns nothing about the secret (except, perhaps, its size).</li>
</ol>
<p>Temporary session authentication keys may be generated from long-term shared secret keys by CSPs and distributed to third party verifiers, in an appropriate protocol, but long- term shared secrets shall not be shared with any third parties, including third party verifiers. Session authentication keys are typically created by cryptographically combining the long term shared secret with a nonce challenge, to generate a session key. The challenge and session key are securely transmitted to the verifier. The verifier in turn sends only the challenge to the claimant, and the claimant applies the challenge to the long-term shared secret to generate the session key. Both claimant and verifier now share a session key, which can be used for authentication. Such protocols are permitted at this level provided that all keys preserve at least 80-bits of entropy and approved cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES, SHA-1, SHA256, HMAC) are used for all operations.</p>

<p>Level 4 is intended to provide the highest practical remote network authentication assurance. Level 4 authentication is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. Level 4 is similar to Level 3 except that only “hard” cryptographic tokens are allowed, FIPS 140-2 cryptographic module validation requirements are strengthened, and subsequent critical data transfers must be authenticated via a key bound to the authentication process. The token shall be a hardware cryptographic module validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher overall with at least FIPS 140-2 Level 3 physical security. By requiring a physical token, which cannot readily be copied and since FIPS 140-2 requires operator authentication at Level 2 and higher, this level ensures good, two factor remote authentication.
Level 4 requires strong cryptographic authentication of all parties and all sensitive data transfers between the parties. Either public key or symmetric key technology may be used. Authentication requires that the claimant shall prove through a secure authentication protocol that he or she controls the token. The protocol threats defined in section 8.1.1 above (eavesdropper, replay, on-line guessing, verifier impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks) shall be prevented. In addition, the token shall protect the secret from compromise by the malicious code threat as described in section 8.1.3 above. Long-term shared authentication secrets, if used, shall never be revealed to any party except the claimant and CSP; however session (temporary) shared secrets may be provided to verifiers or relying parties by the CSP.
