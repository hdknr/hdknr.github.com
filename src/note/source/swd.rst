5.  IANA Considerations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1.  The Well-Known URI Registry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This document establishes the well-known URI registry.

Well-known URIs are registered on the advice of one or more Designated Experts 
(appointed by the IESG or their delegate), 
with a Specification Required (using terminology from [:rfc:`5226`]).  

However,
to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication, 
the Designated Expert(s) may approve registration once they are satisfied
that such a specification will be published.

Registration requests should be sent to 
the wellknown-uri-review@ietf.org mailing list 
for review and comment,
with an appropriate subject 
(e.g., "Request for well-known URI: example").

Before a period of 14 days has passed, 
the Designated Expert(s) will either approve or deny the registration request, 
communicating this decision both to the review list and to IANA.  
Denials should include an explanation and, 
if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.  
Registration requests 
that are undetermined for a period longer than 21 days 
can be brought to the IESG's attention 
(using the iesg@iesg.org mailing list) for resolution.

5.1.1.  Registration Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

URI suffix:  

    The name requested for the well-known URI, relative to "/.well-known/"; e.g., "example".

Change controller:  

    For Standards-Track RFCs, state "IETF".  
    For others, give the name of the responsible party.  
    Other details (e.g., postal address, e-mail address, home page URI) may also be included.

Specification document(s):  
    Reference to the document that specifies the field, 
    preferably including a URI that can be used to retrieve a copy of the document.  
    An indication of the relevant sections may also be included, but is not required.

Related information:  
    Optionally, citations to additional documents containing further relevant information.
