3.1.3.3 Will Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the Will Flag is set to 1 the Will Message is the next field in the payload. The Will Message defines the Application Message that is to be published to the Will Topic as described in Section 3.1.2.5. This field consists of a two byte length followed by the payload for the Will Message expressed as a sequence of zero or more bytes. The length gives the number of bytes in the data that follows and does not include the 2 bytes taken up by the length itself.


When the Will Message is published to the Will Topic its payload consists only of the data portion of this field, not the first two length bytes.
