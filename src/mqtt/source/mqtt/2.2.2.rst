2.2.2 Flags
------------------------

The remaining bits [3-0] of byte 1 in the fixed header contain flags specific to each MQTT Control Packet type as listed in the Table 2.2 - Flag Bits below. Where a flag bit is marked as “Reserved” in Table 2.2 - Flag Bits, it is reserved for future use and MUST be set to the value listed in that table [MQTT-2.2.2-1]. If invalid flags are received, the receiver MUST close the Network Connection [MQTT-2.2.2-2]. See Section 4.8 for details about handling errors.
