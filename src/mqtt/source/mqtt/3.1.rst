3.1 CONNECT â€“ Client requests a connection to a Server
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a Network Connection is established by a Client to a Server, 
the first Packet sent from the Client to the Server MUST be a CONNECT Packet [MQTT-3.1.0-1].
 
A Client can only send the CONNECT Packet 
once over a Network Connection. 

The Server MUST process a second CONNECT Packet sent from a Client as a protocol violation 
and disconnect the Client [MQTT-3.1.0-2].  

See section :ref:`mqtt.4.8` for information about handling errors.
 
The payload contains one or more encoded fields. 

They specify 
a **unique Client identifier** for the Client, 
a **Will topic**, 
**Will Message**, 
**User Name** and **Password**. 

All but the Client identifier are **optional** 
and their presence is determined based on flags in the variable header.
