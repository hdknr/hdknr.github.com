3.3.5 Actions
------------------------

The Client uses a PUBLISH Packet to send an Application Message to the Server, for distribution to Clients with matching subscriptions.
 
The Server uses a PUBLISH Packet to send an Application Message to each Client which has a matching subscription.
 
When Clients make subscriptions with Topic Filters that include wildcards, it is possible for a Client’s subscriptions to overlap so that a published message might match multiple filters. In this case the Server MUST deliver the message to the Client respecting the maximum QoS of all the matching subscriptions [MQTT-3.3.5-1]. In addition, the Server MAY deliver further copies of the message, one for each additional matching subscription and respecting the subscription’s QoS in each case. 
 
The action of the recipient when it receives a PUBLISH Packet depends on the QoS level as described in Section 4.3.
 
If a Server implementation does not authorize a PUBLISH to be performed by a Client; it has no way of informing that Client. It MUST either make a positive acknowledgement, according to the normal QoS rules, or close the Network Connection [MQTT-3.3.5-2].
