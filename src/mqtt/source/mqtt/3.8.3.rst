3.8.3 Payload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The payload of a SUBSCRIBE Packet contains a list of Topic Filters 
indicating the Topics to which the Client wants to subscribe. 

The Topic Filters in a SUBSCRIBE packet payload MUST be UTF-8 encoded strings 
as defined in Section :ref:`1.5.3 <mqtt.1.5.3>` [MQTT-3.8.3-1]. 

A Server SHOULD support Topic filters that contain the wildcard characters defined in Section 4.7.1. 

If it chooses not to support topic filters that contain wildcard characters 
it MUST reject any Subscription request whose filter contains them [MQTT-3.8.3-2]. 

Each filter is followed by a byte called the Requested QoS. 
This gives the maximum QoS level at which the Server can send Application Messages to the Client.
 
The payload of a SUBSCRIBE packet MUST contain at least one Topic Filter / QoS pair. 
A SUBSCRIBE packet with no payload is a protocol violation [MQTT-3.8.3-3]. 
See section 4.8 for information about handling errors.
 
The requested maximum QoS field is encoded in the byte following each UTF-8 encoded topic name, 
and these Topic Filter / QoS pairs are packed contiguously.

The upper 6 bits of the Requested QoS byte are not used in the current version of the protocol. 

They are reserved for future use. 

The Server MUST treat a SUBSCRIBE packet as malformed and close the Network Connection 
if any of Reserved bits in the payload are non-zero, or QoS is not 0,1 or 2 [MQTT-3-8.3-4].
