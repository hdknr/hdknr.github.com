3.3.3 Payload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Payload contains the Application Message that is being published. The content and format of the data is application specific. The length of the payload can be calculated by subtracting the length of the variable header from the Remaining Length field that is in the Fixed Header. It is valid for a PUBLISH Packet to contain a zero length payload.
