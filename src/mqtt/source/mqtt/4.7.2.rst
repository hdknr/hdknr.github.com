4.7.2  Topics beginning with $
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Server **MUST NOT** match **Topic Filters** starting with a wildcard character (# or +) 
with Topic Names beginning with a $ character [MQTT-4.7.2-1]. 

The Server SHOULD prevent Clients from using such Topic Names to exchange messages with other Clients. 

Server implementations MAY use Topic Names that start with a leading $ character for other purposes.

    - $SYS/ has been widely adopted as a prefix to topics that contain Server-specific information or control APIs
    - Applications cannot use a topic with a leading $ character for their own purposes

    - A subscription to “#” will not receive any messages published to a topic beginning with a $
    - A subscription to “+/monitor/Clients” will not receive any messages published to “$SYS/monitor/Clients”
    - A subscription to “$SYS/#” will receive messages published to topics beginning with “$SYS/”
    - A subscription to “$SYS/monitor/+” will receive messages published to “$SYS/monitor/Clients”
    - For a Client to receive messages from topics that begin with $SYS/ and from topics that don’t begin with a $, it has to subscribe to both “#” and “$SYS/#”
