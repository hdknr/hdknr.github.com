3.8 SUBSCRIBE - Subscribe to topics
------------------------------------------

The SUBSCRIBE Packet is sent from the Client to the Server 
to create one or more Subscriptions. 

Each Subscription registers a Clientâ€™s interest in one or more Topics. 

The Server sends PUBLISH Packets to the Client 
in order to forward Application Messages that were published to Topics that match these Subscriptions. 

The SUBSCRIBE Packet also specifies (for each Subscription) the maximum QoS 
with which the Server can send Application Messages to the Client.
