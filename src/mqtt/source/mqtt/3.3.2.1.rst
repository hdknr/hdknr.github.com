3.3.2.1 Topic Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Topic Name identifies the information channel to which payload data is published.
 
The Topic Name MUST be present as the first field in the PUBLISH Packet Variable header. It MUST be a UTF-8 encoded string [MQTT-3.3.2-1] as defined in section 1.5.3.
The Topic Name in the PUBLISH Packet MUST NOT contain wildcard characters [MQTT-3.3.2-2].
The Topic Name in a PUBLISH Packet sent by a Server to a subscribing Client MUST match the Subscriptionâ€™s Topic Filter according to the matching process defined in Section 4.7  [MQTT-3.3.2-3]. However, since the Server is permitted to override the Topic Name, it might not be the same as the Topic Name in the original PUBLISH Packet.
