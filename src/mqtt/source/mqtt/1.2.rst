    Network Connection:
       A construct provided by the underlying transport protocol that is being used by MQTT.

       - It connects the Client to the Server.
       - It provides the means to send an ordered, lossless, stream of bytes in both directions.

       For examples see Section 4.2.

    Application Message
        The data carried by the MQTT protocol across the network for the application. 
        When Application Messages are transported by MQTT they have an associated Quality of Service and a Topic Name.


    Client
        A program or device that uses MQTT. 
        A Client always establishes the Network Connection to the Server. It can

        - Publish Application Messages that other Clients might be interested in.
        - Subscribe to request Application Messages that it is interested in receiving.
        - Unsubscribe to remove a request for Application Messages.
        - Disconnect from the Server.


    Server
        A program or device that acts as an intermediary between Clients 
        which publish Application Messages and Clients which have made Subscriptions. A Server

        - Accepts Network Connections from Clients.

        - Accepts Application Messages published by Clients.

        - Processes Subscribe and Unsubscribe requests from Clients.

        - Forwards Application Messages that match Client Subscriptions.


    Subscription
        A Subscription comprises a Topic Filter and a maximum QoS. 
        A Subscription is associated with a single Session. 
        A Session can contain more than one Subscription. 
        Each Subscription within a session has a different Topic Filter.

    Topic Name
        The label attached to an Application Message 
        which is matched against the Subscriptions known to the Server. 


        The Server sends a copy of the Application Message to each Client that has a matching Subscription.


    Topic Filter
        An expression contained in a Subscription, to indicate an interest in one or more topics. A Topic Filter can include wildcard characters.

    Session
        A stateful interaction between a Client and a Server. 
        Some Sessions last only as long as the Network Connection, others can span multiple consecutive Network Connections between a Client and a Server.

    MQTT Control Packet:
        A packet of information that is sent across the Network Connection. 

        The MQTT specification defines fourteen different types of Control Packet, one of which (the PUBLISH packet) is used to convey Application Messages.
