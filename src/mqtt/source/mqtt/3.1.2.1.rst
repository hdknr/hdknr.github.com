3.1.2.1 Protocol Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. image:: mqtt/fig.3.2.png


The Protocol Name is a **UTF-8** encoded string that represents the protocol name “MQTT”, 
capitalized as shown. 

The string, 
its offset and length will not be changed by future versions of the MQTT specification.
 
If the protocol name is incorrect the Server MAY disconnect the Client, 
or it MAY continue processing the CONNECT packet in accordance with some other specification. 

In the latter case, 
the Server MUST NOT continue to process the CONNECT packet in line with this specification [MQTT-3.1.2-1].


.. note:: Non normative comment

    Packet inspectors, such as firewalls, could use the Protocol Name to identify MQTT traffic.
