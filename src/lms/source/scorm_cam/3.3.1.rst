3.3.1. Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metadata is defined as “data about data”. 

The metadata depicted in Figure 3.3a 
is used to describe the content package 
(i.e., content aggregation) as a whole. 

This metadata enables the search 
and discoverability of the content package itself. 

It also enables a mechanism 
for describing the characteristics of the content package.

.. note::
    ADL Note: 

    Metadata can also be used at various locations 
    within the manifest to describe the different aspects 
    of the content package 
    (refer to :ref:`Section 4.5.1 <scorm_cam.4.5.1>`: 
    Associating Metadata with SCORM Components for more information).
