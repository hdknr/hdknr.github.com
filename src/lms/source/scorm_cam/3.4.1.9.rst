3.4.1.9. <item> Element
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    - leaf timeは <resource>を参照すること

The <item> element is a node that describes 
the hierarchical structure of the organization [3]. 

The <item> element represents an :term:`activity` 
in the content organization. 

The <item> element describes a node 
within the organization’s structure. 

The <item> element can be nested and repeated 
within other <item> elements to any number of levels. 

This structuring of <item> elements shapes the content organization 
and describes the relationships 
between parts of the learning content.

The <item> element can act as a **container** of other <item> elements 
or as a **leaf node**. 

If an <item> is a leaf node, 
then the <item> shall reference a <resource> element. 

If an <item> element is a parent element, 
the <item> itself is not permitted to reference a <resource> element 
(only leaf <item> elements are permitted to reference resources).

XML Namespace: http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/imscp_v1p1
XML Namespace Prefix: imscp
XML Binding Representation: <item>
SCORM Requirements: SCORM places a requirement that all manifests shall adhere to the following multiplicity requirements for the <item> element:


.. list-table::

    *   - SCORM Content Packaging ￼￼Application Profile
        - Manifest Multiplicity Requirements

    *   - Content Aggregation
        - 1 or More

    *   - Resource
        - 0

For Resource Content Packages, 
this element shall not appear. 

The <organizations> element is required to be empty.

Data Type: 

    The <item> element is a parent element. 

    Parent elements have no values associated with them. 

    Parent elements act as “containers” for other elements/attributes. 

    The <item> element contains the following elements/attributes:


Attributes:

    - identifier(mandatory): 

      An identifier attribute is an identifier, for the item, 
      that is unique within the manifest. 

      XML Data Type: xs:ID.

    - identifierref(optional): 

      The identifierref attribute is a reference to an identifier 
      in the resources section or a (sub)manifest [3].

      .. note::
            ADL Note: The IMS Global Learning Consortium, Inc., is working on a new version of the IMS Content Packaging Specification. One of the major issues that IMS is resolving deals with (sub)manifests, their use, requirements of use and XML syntax requirements. At this time, ADL recommends not to use (sub)manifests until completion of the IMS work. Any questions, concerns or further recommendations on (sub)manifests should be sent to ADL.

      If no **identifierref** is supplied, 
      it is assumed that there is no content associated with this entry 
      in the organization. 

      The value has an SPM of 2000 characters. 

      XML Data Type: xs:string.

    - isvisible(optional): 

      The **isvisible** attribute indicates 
      whether or not this item is displayed 
      when the structure of the package is displayed or rendered. 

      If not present, 
      value is defaulted to be **true** [3]. 

      The value only affects the item 
      for which it is defined and 
      not the children of the item  
      or a resource associated with an item. 

      XMLDataType:xs:boolean.

    - parameters(optional): 

      The parameters attribute contains the static parameters to be passed to the resource at launch time. The parameters attribute should only be used for <item> elements that reference <resource> elements. The value has an SPM of 1000 characters. XML Data Type: xs:string.

      The accepted syntax for the parameters attribute value shall be:

        - #<parameter>
        - <name>=<value>(&<name>=<value>)*(#<parameter>) 
        - ?<name>=<value>(&<name>=<value>)*(#<parameter>)

      Where:

        - <parameter>, <name> and <value> is some implementation defined character string value
        - = is required to separate the <name> and <value> pair
        - & is required to separate multiple sets of <name> and <value> pairs
        - (&<name>=<value>) * indicates that 0 or more <name> and <value> pairs can be concatenated together

      The characters used in the parameters value 
      may need to be URL encoded. 

      :rfc:`3986` defines the requirements for encoding URLs.

-  <title>
-  <item>
-  <metadata>
-  <adlcp:timeLimitAction>
-  <adlcp:dataFromLMS>
-  <adlcp:completionThreshold>
