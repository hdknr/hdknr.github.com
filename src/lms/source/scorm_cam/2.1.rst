2.1. SCORM Content Model Components
------------------------------------------------------------

The SCORM Content Model describes the SCORM components used to build a learning experience from learning resources. The content model also defines how these lower- level sharable, learning resources are aggregated and organized into higher-level units of instruction. The SCORM Content Model is made up of assets, sharable content objects (SCOs), activities, a content organization and content aggregations.
