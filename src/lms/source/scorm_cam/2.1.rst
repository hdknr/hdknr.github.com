2.1. SCORM Content Model Components
------------------------------------------------------------


The SCORM Content Model 
describes the SCORM components used to build a learning experience 
from :term:`learning resources`. 

The content model also defines how these lower-level sharable, 
learning resources are aggregated and organized into higher-level units 
of instruction. 


The SCORM Content Model is made up of 
:term:`assets`, 
:term:`sharable content objects` (SCOs), 
:term:`activities`, 
a :term:`content organization` and 
:term:`content aggregations`.
