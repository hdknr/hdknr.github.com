3.2.1. Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A :term:`package` represents a unit of learning. 

The unit of learning may be part of a course 
that has instructional relevance outside of a course organization 
and can be delivered independently, as a portion of a course, 
an entire course or as a collection of courses. 

Once a package arrives at its destination, 
the package must allow itself to be disaggregated or aggregated. 

A package must be able to stand alone; that is, 
it must contain all the information needed 
to use the packaged contents for learning when it has been unpacked.
