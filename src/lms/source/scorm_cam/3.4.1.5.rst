3.4.1.5. {Metadata}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Metadata can be inserted into a manifest 
using an appropriate metadata scheme [3]. 

If using metadata to describe SCORM Content Model Components, 
ADL highly recommends, at a minimum, 
the use of the IEEE LOM metadata scheme. 

Organizations may use various other metadata schemes 
if necessary (e.g., work being performed by Dublin Core). 

This metadata describes the package as a whole. 

There are several mechanisms for inserting metadata in a manifest. 
Metadata can be inserted into a manifest by extensions to the XML (inline metadata). 

ADL also provides a namespaced element 
(refer to :ref:`Section 3.4.1.5.2 <scorm_cam.3.4.1.5.2>`: <location> Element) 
to permit a reference to a stand- alone XML file. 

The {Metadata}, found as a child of the <metadata>, 
is optional (can appear 0 or More times using one of the mechanisms described). 

The example below illustrates the use of inline XML extensions of the LOM elements.
