3.4.1.23. <resource> Element
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The <resource> element is a reference to a resource [3]. There are two primary types of resources defined within SCORM:

- SCOs 
- assets

XML Namespace: http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/imscp_v1p1
XML Namespace Prefix: imscp
XML Binding Representation: <resource>
SCORM Requirements: SCORM places a requirement that all manifests shall adhere to the following multiplicity requirements for the <resource> element:


.. list-table::

    *   - SCORM Content Packaging￼Application Profile
        - Manifest Multiplicity Requirements

    *   - Content Aggregation
        - 0 or More

    *   - Resource
        - 0 or More


A leaf <item> element is required to reference a resource 
(SCO resource or asset resource). 

If an <item> references a resource, 
this resource is subject to being identified for delivery 
and launch to the learner. 

If an <item> references a <resource>, 
then the <resource> element shall meet the following requirements:

- The type attribute should be set to webcontent.

- The adlcp:scormType shall be set to sco or asset.

- The href attribute shall be required.

Data Type: The <resource> element is a parent element. Parent elements have no values associated with them. Parent elements act as “containers” for other elements/attributes. 

The <resource> element contains the following elements/attributes:
Attributes:

- identifier(mandatory): 

  The identifier attribute represents an identifier,of the resource, that is unique within the scope of its containing manifest file [3]. This identifier is typically provided by an author or authoring tool. XML Data Type: xs:ID.

- type(mandatory): The type attribute indicates the type of resource[3]. The value has an SPM of 1000 characters. XML Data Type: xs:string.

- href(optional): The href attribute is a reference a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) [3]. 

  The href attribute represents the “entry point” or “launching point” of this resource. External fully qualified URLs are also permitted. The URL may also contain additional parameters (refer to Section 3.4.3.3: Handling Additional Parameters as Part of URLs for information regarding the handling of these parameters). This value is affected by the use of xml:base values. Refer to Section 3.4.3.1: Handling the XML Base Attribute for more information on xml:base usage requirements and guidance. The value has an SPM of 2000 characters. The SPM represents the length of the href with the values of any xml:base applied to it. XML Data Type: xs:string.

- xml:base(optional): 

  The xml:base attribute provides a relative path offset for the files contained in the manifest. The usage of this element is defined in the XML Base Working Draft from the W3C. The value has an SPM of 2000 characters. XMLDataType:xs:anyURI.

- adlcp:scormType(mandatory): Theadlcp:scormTypeattributedefinesthetype of SCORM resource. This is an ADL defined extension to the IMS Content Packaging Information Model. XML Data Type: xs:string. The character string is restricted and shall be one of the following characterstring tokens (sco or asset). 

  Where **sco** indicates that the resource is a SCO resource and **asset** indicates that the resource is an asset resource.


Elements:

- <metadata>
- <file>
- <dependency>

       <resource identifier="R_A3" type="webcontent" adlcp:scormType="sco"
                 href="sco3.html">
          <file href="sco3.html"/>
       </resource>
       <resource identifier="R_A5" type="webcontent" adlcp:scormType="asset"
