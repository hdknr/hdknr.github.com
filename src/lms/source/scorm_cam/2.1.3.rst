2.1.3. Activities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A :term:`learning activity` may be loosely described 
as a meaningful unit of instruction; 
it is conceptually something the learner does 
while progressing through instruction. 

A learning activity may provide a :term:`learning resource` 
(:term:`SCO` or :term:`asset`) 
to the learner or it may be composed of several sub-activities.

The activities represented in a :term:`content organization` 
may consist of other activities (sub- activities), 
which may themselves consist of other activities. 

There is no set limit to the number of levels of nesting for activities. 

While a specific learning taxonomy may be associated with hierarchical levels of activities, 
(e.g., course, chapter, module, etc.), 
this is not a requirement. 

Activities that do not consist of other activities (leaf activities) 
will have an associated learning resource (SCO or asset) 
that is used to perform the activity.


Activities that consist of other activities are also called :term:`clusters`. 

Refer to the :doc:`SCORM SN book <scorm_sn>` for more details 
on how sequencing evaluations can be defined for activities and clusters.

Each activity in a content organization can reference :term:`metadata` 
to allow for search and discovery within repositories, 
thereby enabling opportunities for reuse and facilitating maintenance.
