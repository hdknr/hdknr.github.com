----------------------------------------

The :term:`manifest` file represents 
the information needed 
to describe the contents of the package. 

Figure 3.3a describes the makeup of a manifest file.

The manifest is composed of four major sections:

1. :term:`Metadata`: 

   Data describing the content package as a whole.

2. :term:`Organizations`: 

   Contains the content structure or organization 
   of the learning resources making up a stand-alone unit 
   or units of instruction. 
 
   A definition of sequencing intent can be associated 
   with the content structure.

3. :term:`Resources`: 

   Defines the learning resources 
   bundled in the content package.

4. (sub)Manifest(s): 

   Describes any logically nested units of instruction 
   (which can be treated as stand-alone units).
