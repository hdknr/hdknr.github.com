1.1.2. Relationship with Other SCORM Books
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the various SCORM books are intended to stand alone, 
there are areas of overlap or mutual coverage. 

For instance, 
while this book focuses primarily on elements of SCORM content 
such as SCOs and assets, 
those objects are launched by SCORM compliant learning management systems (LMSs), 
and so the SCORM Run-Time Environment (:term:`RTE`) book [2], 
covering content launch is mentioned numerous times.

Similarly, 
while the Sequencing and Navigation (:term:`SN`) book covers 
the details of SCORM sequencing and navigation processes, 
including detailed coverage of 
how an LMS evaluates navigation requests and related activities, 
this book deals with manifests which contain the sequencing information 
described by the SCORM SN book, 
and so some of the basics of sequencing and navigation are addressed.

To help clarify areas of overlap, 
:ref:`Section 1.1.3.1 <scorm_rte.1.1.3.1>`: The SCORM Run-Time Environment Book and 
:ref:`Section 1.1.3.2 <scorm_sn.1.1.2.1>`: The SCORM Sequencing and Navigation Book 
provides brief descriptions of the contents of these SCORM books.
