2.1.1. Asset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`asset` is the **basic building block** of a :term:`learning resource`. 

Assets are an electronic representation of media, 
such as text, images, sound, assessment objects 
or any other piece of data that can be rendered 
by a **Web client** and presented to a learner 
(refer to Figure 2.1.1a). 

More than one asset can be collected together 
to build other assets. 

In some cases, 
assets may be launched as part of the learning experience.

An asset can be described with :term:`metadata` 
(Refer to the asset metadata definition below) 
to allow for search and discovery within repositories, 
thereby enabling opportunities for reuse and facilitating maintenance.
