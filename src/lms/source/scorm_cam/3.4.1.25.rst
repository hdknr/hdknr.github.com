3.4.1.25. <file> Element
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The <file> element is a listing of files that a resource described by a <resource> element requires for delivery. This element is repeated as necessary for each file for a given resource. The element acts as an inventory system detailing the set of files used to build the resource. The <file> element represents files that are local to the content package. For all files that are required for delivery of the content package in a SCORM run-time environment and are local to the content package (physically located in the content package), a <file> element shall be used to represent the file relative to the resource in which it is used. If the resource identified by a <resource> element is local to the package, then the resource itself shall be identified as a <file> element. The launch location of the <resource> (<resource>’s href value) shall be used as the href ofthefile. 

The value of the <file> element’s href attribute should not contain any parameters that may have been defined on the <resource> element’s href attribute.

All of the physical files that are included in the content package should be referenced by a file element. Leaving these references to the physical files out of the manifest may cause a wide range of problems.
XML Namespace: http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/imscp_v1p1
XML Namespace Prefix: imscp
XML Binding Representation: <file>
SCORM Requirements: SCORM places a requirement that all manifests shall adhere to the following multiplicity requirements for the <file> element:


.. list-table::
    *   - SCORM Content Packaging￼Application Profile
        - Manifest Multiplicity Requirements

    *   - Content Aggregation
        - 0 or More

    *   - Resource
        - 0 or More


Data Type: The <file> element is a parent element. Parent elements have no values associated with them. Parent elements act as “containers” for other elements/attributes. The <file> element contains the following elements/attributes:

Attributes:

- href(mandatory): 
  The href attribute identifies the location of the file[3]. This value is affected by the use of xml:base values. Some systems may treat this value as case sensitive, developers should be aware of this and ensure that values used match the resources being referenced. Refer to Section 3.4.3.1: Handling the XML Base Attribute for more information on xml:base usage requirements and guidance. The value has an SPM of 2000 characters. The SPM represents the length of the href with the values of any xml:base applied to it. XML Data Type: xs:string.

Elements:

- <metadata>

Example: Code Illustration 3-23: <file> Element

       <file href="assets/image1.gif"/>
       <file href="sco1.html"/>
