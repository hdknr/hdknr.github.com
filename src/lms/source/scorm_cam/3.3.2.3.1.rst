3.3.2.3.1. Content Hierarchy
##########################################

A collection of learning resources 
can usually be organized into a hierarchy, 
which can be represented as a content organization. 

Another approach to organizing learning resources is 
to define a hierarchy of activities 
that rely on the resources to provide a specific learning experience. 

In this case the top-level of the hierarchy is the main activity, 
which can consist of sub-activities, 
which can themselves consist of sub-activities. 

Depending on the design methodology, 
this hierarchical grouping might be used to represent concepts 
like course, chapter, topic or similar terms 
that represent how the content is organized for delivery to a learner.

The IMS Content Packaging Specification defines 
a set of terms that are used in representing the content hierarchy. 

Figure 3.3.2.3.1a depicts 
how a content organization forms a hierarchical structure 
that maps to a collection of learning resources 
(as defined by the IMS Content Packaging Specification). 

The hierarchical structure is a tree of nested Item elements. 

The root of the tree is the Organization element. 

An Item element may reference a Resource element, 
which describes a specific learning resource to be launched 
when the Item is used as an activity. 

The same Resource element may be referenced by more than one Item element.

SCORM and the IMS SS Specification [5] are application profiles 
of the IMS Content Packaging Specification, 
and as such they add a couple of restrictions. 

Only leaf Items 
(Item elements that do not have children) may reference a learning resource. 

Another is that an Organization element must contain at least one Item.

In addition, 
SCORM requires that a learning resource be either a SCO or an asset. 

These will be described in more detail 
in the section on :term:`resources`.
