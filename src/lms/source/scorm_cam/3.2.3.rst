3.2.3.  Package Interchange File (PIF)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Package Interchange File (PIF) is a binding of the content package components in the form of a compressed archive file. The PIF contains the imsmanifest.xml, all control files and the resources referenced in the content package (those that are local to the PIF, i.e., contained in the content package). SCORM recommends that content packages be created as PIFs. The PIF provides a concise Web delivery format that can be used to transport content packages between systems. If a PIF is used for representing the content package, SCORM requires that the PIF be conformant with RFC 1951 [12]. In addition to this requirement, SCORM mandates that the archive format be PKZip v2.04g (.zip). This .zip file is conformant to :rfc:`1951`.
