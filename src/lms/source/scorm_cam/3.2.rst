3.2. Content Package Components
---------------------------------------


This section contains an overview of content packages, 
the nomenclature used to describe content packages 
and the makeup of content packages. 

The IMS Content Packaging Specification describes data structures 
that are used to provide interoperability of web-enabled content 
with authoring tools, 
LMSs and run-time environments. 

The objective of the IMS Content Packaging Specification 
is to define a standardized set of structures 
that can be used to exchange content. 

The scope of the IMS Content Packaging Specification is focused 
on defining interoperability 
between systems that wish to import, export, aggregate 
and disaggregate content packages.

A content package contains two major components:

• A special XML document describing the content structure 
  and associated resources of the package 
  called the :term:`manifest` file (:term:`imsmanifest.xml`). 

  Refer to :ref:`Section 3.3 <scorm_cam.3.3>`: 
  Components of a Manifest for more details on manifests. 

  A manifest is required to be present at the root of the content package.

• The content (i.e., physical files) making up the content package.


Figure 3.2a is a conceptual diagram that illustrates 
the components of a content package.
