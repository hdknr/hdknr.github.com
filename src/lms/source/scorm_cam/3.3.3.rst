3.3.3. Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The resources component of a manifest 
can describe external resources, 
as well as the content located in the content package. 

These files may be media files, 
text files, assessment objects 
or other pieces of data in electronic form. 

Conceptual groupings and relationships between files 
can be represented within the resources component. 

The combination of resources is generally categorized 
as “content.” 

The resources are referred to at various points 
within the organizations component, 
which provides the structure for the resources.

In Figure 3.3.3a, 
a single resource is made up of multiple components. 

In SCORM, 
these components are simple assets. 

If the resource was built to communicate 
with an LMS (refer to the :doc:`SCORM RTE book <scorm_rte>` [2]) 
then the resource is a :term:`SCO`. 

If the resource was not built to communicate with an LMS 
the resource is considered an :term:`asset`. 

The collection of resource components makes up the resources 
that an organization can refer to. 

This collection of resources and the organization defines 
the content organization.

The resource describes the physical makeup (inventory of components) 
of the resource as a whole. 

The components of the resource are listed 
as File elements within a Resource element.
