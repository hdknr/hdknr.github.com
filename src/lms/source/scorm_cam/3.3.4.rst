3.3.4. Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The content (i.e., physical files) component represents 
the actual files 
referenced in the resources component. 

These files may be local files 
that are actually contained within the content package, 
or they can be external files 
that are referenced by a Universal Resource Indicator (URI). 

All of the physical files included 
in the content package should be declared 
and referenced in the manifest 
when interchanging content packages. 

Including files in a content package 
that are not referenced in the manifest can lead to a wide range of problems 
when the content package is imported into, 
run or exported from a system. 

During one of these processes the physical files 
may be needed to complete the content package. 

Systems will use the :term:`manifest` 
to determine the makeup of the content package. 

If physical files are not listed 
in the manifest then there is the chance of corrupting the content package 
at a later time.
