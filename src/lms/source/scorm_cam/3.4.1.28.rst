    ADL Note: The IMS Global Learning Consortium Inc., is working on a new version of the IMS Content Packaging Specification. One of the major revisions that IMS is resolving deals with (sub)manifests, their use, requirements of use and XML syntax requirements. At this time, ADL recommends not to use (sub)manifests until completion of the IMS work. Any questions, concerns or further recommendations on (sub)manifests should be sent to ADL.
