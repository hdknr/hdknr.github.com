3.4.1.14. <dataFromLMS> Element
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The <dataFromLMS> element provides initialization data 
expected by the resource (i.e., SCO) 
represented by the <item> after launch. 

This data is opaque to the LMS and only has functional meaning to the SCO. 

This element shall not be used for parameters that 
the SCO may need during the launch (query string parameters). 

If this type of functionality is required, 
then the developer should use the parameters attribute of the item referencing the SCO resource.

This element is an ADL defined extension 
to the IMS Content Packaging Specification. 

The element shall only appear, if needed, 
as a child of a leaf <item> element. 

Only those <item> elements that reference a SCO resource can contain the <dataFromLMS> element).
The LMS shall use the value of the <dataFromLMS> element, if provided, to initialize the cmi.launch_data data model element (refer to SCORM Run-Time Environment book [2]).
