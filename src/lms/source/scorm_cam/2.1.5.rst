2.1.5. Content Aggregation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

:term:`Content aggregation` can be used as 
both an **action** and as **a way of describing a conceptual entity**. 

Content aggregation can be used 
to describe the action or process of composing a set of functionally 
related content objects 
so that the set can be applied in a learning experience. 

In terms of the SCORM Content Model, 
a content aggregation is also used 
to describe the entity created as part of this process or action. 

Sometimes the term is loosely used to describe the content package. 

The content aggregation can then be used 
to deliver the content and prescribed content structure, 
transferred between systems or even stored in a repository.
