3.3.2.3. Representing Content Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A SCORM content organization includes components 
that are intended to define different aspects of a content structure:

• Content Hierarchy: 

  This is a tree-shaped representation, 
  much like a table of contents that represents a logical organization 
  for the learning resources or activities 
  that use the learning resources. 

  In many cases, but not all, 
  this hierarchical tree can be traversed in a specific order 
  that represents the default order in which an author intends 
  for the learner to progress through the material.

• Metadata: 

  This is optional, 
  context-specific descriptive data about the content structure 
  or organization. 

  Such metadata can be used to describe 
  how a particular learning resource is to be used 
  in a particular content organization 
  (e.g.,   
  competency or objectives that may be met by a learner 
  when the learning resource is used in a particular activity).

• Sequencing, Adaptive Sequencing and Navigation: 

  Optional prescriptions may be embedded in the content organization 
  if the content developer wants to control 
  which learning resources are to be presented to the learner 
  as the learner navigates through the content. 

  By default, 
  if no sequencing and navigation prescription is defined, 
  a learner may choose any content item at will. 

  Adding specific prescriptions can alter this default behavior. 

  For example, 
  adding a flow prescription to the items 
  in the content organization will direct the LMS 
  to guide the navigation in the order defined by the organization tree. 

  More complex adaptive sequencing can be based 
  on the completion status of certain learning resources 
  or on more complex computation of user preferences or assessment results.

Content organizations are intended to represent a wide variety of approaches 
to the aggregation of content. 

A content organization can represent a content aggregation 
ranging from very, very small learning resources – 
as simple as a few lines of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) 
or a short media clip – 
to highly interactive learning resources 
that are tracked by an LMS. 

The SCORM CAM is neutral about the complexity of content, 
the number of hierarchical levels of a particular unit of instruction 
(i.e., taxonomy) and the instructional methodology employed.

Table 3.3.2.3a depicts examples of several possible curricular taxonomy models 
as used by the Armed Forces of the United States and Canada, 
which can be represented in a SCORM content organization.
