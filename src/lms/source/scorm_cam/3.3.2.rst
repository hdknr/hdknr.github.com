3.3.2. Organizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`organizations` component is used to describe 
how the content is organized in the content package. 

It may contain one or more organizations, 
each of which describes a particular structure 
for the content of the package. 

The current version of the IMS Content Packaging Specification 
only defines one form of content organization, 
which is in the shape of a **tree** or **hierarchy**. 

Neither the IMS Content Packaging Specification, 
nor SCORM, 
specifies whether this hierarchy should represent a particular learning taxonomy 
or nomenclature. 

In other words, 
SCORM does not specify terms such as “module,” “lesson” 
and so on to describe the levels of hierarchy in a content organization. 

Such terms tend to be resolved in a particular way. 

Therefore, the choice of nomenclature is left to the content developer.
