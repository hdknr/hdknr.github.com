3.3.2.1. Multiple Content Organizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The IMS Content Packaging Specification separates 
:term:`learning resources` from the way those resources are organized, 
allowing for a single content package 
to have one or more organizations 
using the same learning resources within different contexts or uses.

In order to deliver the content package 
to a learner in an LMS, 
there must be at least one content organization. 

In some cases, 
it is useful to define different ways 
to use the content in a package. 

Each of these ways is represented 
in a different content organization. 

When a content package has several content organizations, 
at least one organization must be designated 
as the default organization, 
in order to avoid having the system 
processing the content package decide which content organization to use.
