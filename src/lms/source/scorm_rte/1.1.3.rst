1.1.3. Relationship with other SCORM Books
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the various SCORM books are intended to stand alone, there are areas of overlap or mutual coverage. For instance, while this book focuses primarily on communication between learning content and LMSs, it frequently refers to SCOs that conduct that communication. SCOs are discussed in some detail in the SCORM Content Aggregation Model (CAM) book.
Similarly, while the SCORM Sequencing and Navigation (SN) book covers the details of SCORM sequencing and navigation processes, including detailed coverage of how an LMS evaluates navigation requests and related activities, this book deals with content delivery, and as such, lightly touches on how an LMS determines which piece of content to deliver at any given time.
