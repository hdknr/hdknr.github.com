1.1. Introduction to the SCORM Run-Time Environment (RTE) Book
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


The SCORM RTE book describes the learning management system (LMS) requirements in managing the run-time environment (i.e., content launch process, standardized communication between content and LMSs and standardized data model elements used for passing information relevant to the learnerâ€™s experience with the content). The RTE book also covers the requirements of Sharable Content Objects (SCOs) and their use of a common application programming interface (API) and the SCORM Run-Time Environment Data Model.
