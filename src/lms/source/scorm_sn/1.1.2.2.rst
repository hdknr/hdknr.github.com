1.1.2.2 The SCORM Run-Time Environment (RTE) Book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SCORM Run-Time Environment (RTE) book describes the responsibilities of LMSs and content objects during run-time. In the context of SCORM, content objects are either SCOs, which may communicate during run-time, or assets that do not communicate during run-time. The SCORM RTE book describes a common content object launch mechanism, a common communication mechanism between content objects and LMSs, and a common data model for tracking a learner’s experience with content objects. These aspects create an environment where several of the ADL “-ilities” are satisfied. For example, content objects that communicate through the standardized communication mechanism can be moved from LMS to LMS without modification to their
communication methods. This increases learning object interoperability and durability, thereby lowering the cost of development, installation and maintenance.
