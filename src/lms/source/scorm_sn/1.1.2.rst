1.1.2. Relationship with other SCORM Books
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SCORM SN book describes the responsibilities of LMSs for sequencing content objects for a learner at run-time. In the context of SCORM, content objects are either SCOs, which may communicate during run-time, or assets that do not communicate during run-time. The SCORM SN book describes how sequencing information can be applied to define various sequencing strategies, how sequencing information is interpreted at run-time to make sequencing evaluations and how navigation requests, triggered through a learner’s interactions with content objects, are processed to identify the next content object for delivery (launch). The actual launch of the identified content object is out of scope of this book, but is described in the SCORM RTE book [4].
The following sections explain the relationships between the SCORM SN book and the remaining SCORM books. In addition, frequently used terminology is described at a high level so you don’t have to become an expert in SCORM to understand this book. LMS vendors, content developers, and authoring tool developers should read each SCORM book carefully to fully understand the purpose, details, relationships, and advantages of all of the SCORM components.
