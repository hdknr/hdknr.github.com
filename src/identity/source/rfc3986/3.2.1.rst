3.2.1.  User Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **userinfo** subcomponent may consist of a **user name** and, 
optionally, scheme-specific information 
about how to gain authorization to access the resource.  

The user information, if present, 
is followed by a commercial **at-sign** ("@") that delimits it from the host.

::

   userinfo    = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" )

Use of the format "user:password" in the userinfo field is deprecated.  

.. note::
      - ユーザー:パスワード の書式はもう使わない
      - パスワードの部分は認可取得の為のスキーマごとに使われるヒント

Applications should not render as clear text any data 
after the first colon (":") character found within a userinfo subcomponent 
unless the data after the colon is the empty string (indicating no password).  
Applications may choose to ignore or reject such data 
when it is received as part of a reference and
should reject the storage of such data in unencrypted form.  
The passing of authentication information in clear text has proven to be
a security risk in almost every case where it has been used.

Applications that render a URI for the sake of user feedback, 
such as in graphical hypertext browsing, should render userinfo in a way that
is distinguished from the rest of a URI, when feasible. 
Such rendering will assist the user in cases where the userinfo has been
misleadingly crafted to look like a trusted domain name (Section 7.6).
