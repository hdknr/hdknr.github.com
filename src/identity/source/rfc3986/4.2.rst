4.2.  Relative Reference
------------------------------------

.. note::

    - 相対参照

        - ネットワークパスリファレンス ( //path )
        - 絶対パスリファレンス( /path )
        - 相対パスリファレンス( path ) 

A relative reference takes advantage of 
the hierarchical syntax (Section 1.2.3) 
to express a URI reference 
relative to the name space of another hierarchical URI.

::

   relative-ref  = relative-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

   relative-part = "//" authority path-abempty
                 / path-absolute
                 / path-noscheme
                 / path-empty

The URI referred to by a relative reference, 
also known as the **target URI**, 
is obtained by applying the reference resolution algorithm of Section 5.

A relative reference that 
begins with two slash characters is termed a **network-path reference;** 
such references are rarely used.  

A relative reference that begins with a single slash character is
termed an **absolute-path reference.**  

A relative reference that does not begin with a slash character is termed a **relative-path reference** .

A **path segment** that contains a colon character 
(e.g., "this:that")
cannot be used as the first segment of a relative-path reference, 
as it would be mistaken for a scheme name.  
Such a segment must be preceded by a dot-segment (e.g., "./this:that") 
to make a relative-path reference.
