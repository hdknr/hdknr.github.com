3.2.  Authority
------------------------------------------

Many URI schemes include a hierarchical element for a naming
authority so that governance of the name space defined by the
remainder of the URI is delegated to that authority (which may, in
turn, delegate it further).  The generic syntax provides a common
means for distinguishing an authority based on a registered name or
server address, along with optional port and user information.

The authority component is preceded by a **double slash** ("//") 
and is terminated by 
the next slash ("/"), 
question mark ("?"), 
or number sign ("#") character, 
or by the end of the URI.

::

   authority   = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]

URI producers and normalizers should omit the ":" delimiter that
separates host from port if the port component is empty.  Some
schemes do not allow the userinfo and/or port subcomponents.

If a URI contains an authority component, 
then the **path** component must either be **empty** or begin with a slash ("/") character.  
Non-validating parsers (those that merely separate a URI reference into
its major components) will often ignore the subcomponent structure of
authority, 
treating it as an opaque string from the double-slash to
the first terminating delimiter, until such time as the URI is
dereferenced.
