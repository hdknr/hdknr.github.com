4.  Usage
=============================================

When applications make reference to a URI, 
they do not always use the full form of reference defined by the "URI" syntax rule.  

To save space and take advantage of hierarchical locality, 
many Internet protocol elements and media type formats allow an abbreviation of a URI, 
whereas others restrict the syntax to a particular form of URI.  

We define the most common forms of reference syntax in this
specification because they impact and depend upon the design of the
generic syntax, requiring a uniform parsing algorithm in order to be
interpreted consistently.
