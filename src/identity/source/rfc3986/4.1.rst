4.1.  URI Reference
-----------------------------------

.. note::
    - URI参照 1) URI 2) 相対参照

URI-reference is used to denote 
the most common usage of a resource identifier.

::

   URI-reference = URI / relative-ref



A URI-reference is either a URI or a relative reference.  
If the URI-reference's prefix does not match the syntax of a scheme followed by its colon separator, 
then the URI-reference is a relative reference.

A URI-reference is typically parsed first into the five URI components, 
in order to determine what components are present and whether the reference is relative.  
Then, 
each component is parsed for its subparts and their validation.  
The ABNF of URI-reference, 
along with the "first-match-wins" disambiguation rule, 
is sufficient to define a validating parser for the generic syntax.  

Readers familiar with regular expressions should see 
Appendix B for an example of a non-validating URI-reference parser 
that will take any given string and extract the URI components.
