2.1.1.  sector_identifier_url Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Providers who use pairwise user_id values SHOULD support this element.

It provides a way for a group of websites 
under a single administrative control to have consistent pairwise user_id values 
independent of the individual domain names. 
It also provides a way for Clients to change :term:`redirect_uri` domains 
without having to reregister all of their users.

This is further described in :ref:`Section 2.1.1.1.1 of OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 <messages_2_1_1_1_1>` 
[:term:`OpenID.Messages`].

The value of the :term:`sector_identifier_url` must be a HTTPS scheme URL 
that identifies a JSON file containing an array containing :term:`redirect_uri` values. 
The Registration Server MUST perform a TLS/SSL server certificate check, per RFC 6125 [:term:`RFC6125`].

The values of the registered :term:`redirect_uris <redirect_uri>` must be included 
in the elements of the array, or registration MUST fail.
