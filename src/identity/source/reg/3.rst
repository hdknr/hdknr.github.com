3.  Client Registration
==========================================

The Client Registration Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource through which a Client can request a new registration and manage the Metadata associated with it. The OpenID Provider MAY require an Initial Access Token that is provisioned out-of-band (in a manner that is out of scope for this specification) to restrict registration requests to only authorized Clients.

To support open registration, the Client Registration Endpoint SHOULD accept registration requests without OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens. These requests MAY be rate-limited or otherwise limited to prevent a denial-of-service attack on the Client Registration Endpoint. If an Initial Access Token is required for Client registration, the Client Registration Endpoint MUST be able to accept these Access Tokens in the manner described in the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750] specification.
