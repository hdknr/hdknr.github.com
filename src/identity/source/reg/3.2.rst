3.2.  Client Registration Response
--------------------------------------------

Upon successful registration, 
the :term:`Client Registration Endpoint` returns the newly-created :term:`Client Identifier` and, 
if applicable, a :term:`Client Secret`, 
along with all registered Metadata about this Client, 
including any fields provisioned by the :term:`Authorization Server` itself. 

The Authorization Server MAY reject or replace any of the Client's requested field values 
and substitute them with suitable values. 
If this happens, 
the Authorization Server MUST include these fields in the response to the Client.

The response also contains a :term:`Registration Access Token` 
that is used by the Client to perform subsequent operations upon the resulting Client registration.

All of the response items are returned as a :term:`JSON` document :term:`[RFC4627]` 
with the following fields as top-level members of the root JSON object.

.. glosary::

    client_id
        REQUIRED. Unique Client identifier. It MUST NOT be currently valid for any other registered Client.

    client_secret
        OPTIONAL. Client secret. This MUST be unique for each client_id. This value is used by Confidential Clients to authenticate to the Token Endpoint as described in OAuth 2.0 Section 2.3.1. It is not needed for Clients selecting a token_endpoint_auth_method of private_key_jwt.

    registration_access_token
        REQUIRED. Access Token that is used at the :term:`Client Configuration Endpoint` to perform subsequent operations upon the Client registration.

    registration_client_uri
        REQUIRED. Location where the Access Token can be used to perform subsequent operations upon the resulting Client registration.

    client_id_issued_at
        OPTIONAL. Time at which the Client Identifier was issued. The time is represented as the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.

    client_secret_expires_at
        REQUIRED if client_secret is issued. Time at which the client_secret will expire or 0 if it will not expire. The time is represented as the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.
