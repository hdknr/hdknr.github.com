2.  Client Registration Endpoint
================================================

The :term:`Client Registration Endpoint` is an OAuth 2.0 :term:`Protected Resource` 
that returns registration information for the Client to configure itself for the OpenID Provider.

The OpenID Provider may require an :term:`Access Token` that is provisioned out-of-band 
(in a manner that is out of scope for this specification) in order to restrict registration requests to only authorized Clients.

.. note::
   This is about "close registration".

In order to support :term:`open registration`, 
the Client Registration Endpoint SHOULD accept requests without OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens.

If an :term:`Access Token` is required for Client registration, 
the :term:`Client Registration Endpoint` MUST be able to accept :term:`Access Tokens` in the manner 
described in the Bearer Tokens [:term:`OAuth.Bearer`] specification.
