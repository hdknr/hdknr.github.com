1.  Introduction
========================

In order for an OpenID Connect Client 
to utilize OpenID services for an End-User, 
the Client needs to register with the OpenID Provider to acquire a :term:`Client ID` and :term:`shared secret`. 

This document describes how a new Client can register with the OP, 
and how registration information for the Client can be retrieved.

The :term:`Client Registration Endpoint` MAY be co-resident with the :term:`Token Endpoint` 
as an optimization in some deployments.

Note: This specification will likely be modified 
to use the :doc:`OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol <oauth_reg>` [I‑D.ietf‑oauth‑dyn‑reg] specification 
once it is stable. 

While currently self-contained, 
this specification intentionally uses the same syntax and identifiers as the OAuth Registration draft. 
As of the time of this writing, the two specifications are consistent with one another.

.. note::
    - :doc:`oauth_reg` ベースに書き換えられる予定
