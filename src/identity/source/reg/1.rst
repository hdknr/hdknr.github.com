1.  Introduction
========================

In order for an OpenID Connect Client 
to utilize OpenID services for a user, 
the Client needs to register with the OpenID Provider to acquire a :term:`Client ID` and :term:`shared secret`. 
This document describes how a new Client can register with the provider, 
and how a Client already in possession of a :term:`client_id` can retrieve updated registration information.

The :term:`Client Registration Endpoint` may be co-resident with the :term:`token endpoint` as an optimization in some deployments.
