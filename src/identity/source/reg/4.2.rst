4.2.  Client Read Request
--------------------------------

To read the current configuration of the Client on the Authorization Server, the Client makes an HTTP GET request to the Client Configuration Endpoint with the Registration Access Token.

The following is a non-normative example request:

::


  GET /connect/register?client_id=s6BhdRkqt3 HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/json
  Host: server.example.com
  Authorization: Bearer this.is.an.access.token.value.ffx83
