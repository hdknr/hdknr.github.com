4.  Client Configuration Endpoint
==================================================

The Client Configuration Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 :term:`protected resource` 
that is provisioned by the server 
for a specific Client to be able to view and update its registered information. 
The Client MUST use its :term:`Registration Access Token` in all calls 
to this endpoint as an :doc:`OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token <oauth_bearer>` :term:`[RFC6750]`.

Operations on this endpoint are switched through the use of different HTTP methods [RFC2616]. 
The only method defined for use at this endpoint by this specification is the HTTP GET method.
