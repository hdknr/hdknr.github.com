        OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource through which a Client can be registered at an Authorization Server.

    Registration Access Token
        OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token issued by the Authorization Server through the Client Registration Endpoint that is used to authenticate the caller when accessing the Client's registration information at the Client Configuration Endpoint. This Access Token is associated with a particular registered Client. 

    Initial Access Token
        OAuth 2.0 Access Token optionally issued by an Authorization Server granting access to its Client Registration Endpoint.
