4.4.  Client Read Error Response
------------------------------------

When a read error condition occurs, the Client Configuration Endpoint returns a HTTP 403 Forbidden status code. This indicates that the Access Token is invalid or the Client record requested is invalid or non-existent. Note that for security reasons, to inhibit brute force attacks, endpoints MUST NOT return 404 Not Found error codes.

The following is a non-normative example error response:

::

  HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
  Content-Type: application/json
  Cache-Control: no-store
  Pragma: no-cache
