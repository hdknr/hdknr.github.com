3.3.  Client Registration Error Response
------------------------------------------------

When an OAuth error condition occurs, the Client Registration Endpoint returns an Error Response as defined in Section 3 of the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750] specification.

When a registration error condition occurs, the Client Registration Endpoint returns a HTTP 400 status code including a JSON object describing the error in the response body.

The JSON object contains two members:

.. glossary::

    error
        Error code.

    error_description
        Additional text description of the error for debugging.
        This specification defines the following error codes:
    
    invalid_redirect_uri
        The value of one or more redirect_uris is invalid.

    invalid_client_metadata
        The value of one of the Client Metadata fields is invalid and the server has rejected this request. Note that an Authorization Server MAY choose to substitute a valid value for any requested parameter of a Client's Metadata.

The following is a non-normative example error response:

::

  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
  Content-Type: application/json
  Cache-Control: no-store
  Pragma: no-cache

  {
   "error": "invalid_redirect_uri",
   "error_description": "The value of one or more redirect_uris are invalid."
  }
