Abstract
==========

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the :doc:`OAuth 2.0 protocol <oauth>`. 
It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication 
performed by an Authorization Server, 
as well as to obtain basic profile information 
about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

This specification describes how an OpenID Client can obtain the necessary Client Credentials 
required by the OpenID Connect protocol suite.
