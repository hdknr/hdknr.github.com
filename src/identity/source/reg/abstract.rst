Abstract
==========

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer 
on top of the :term:`OAuth 2.0` protocol. 
It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User 
based on the authentication performed by an :term:`Authorization Server`, 
as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and RESTful manner.

This specification describes how an OpenID Client can obtain the necessary :term:`client credentials` 
required by the OpenID Connect protocol suite.
