4.3.  Client Read Response
------------------------------------

Upon a successful read operation, the Authorization Server SHOULD return all registered Metadata about this Client, including any fields provisioned by the Authorization Server itself. Some values, including the client_secret value, might have been updated since the initial registration.

The Authorization Server need not include the registration_access_token or registration_client_uri value in this response unless they have been updated.

The response is a JSON Document [RFC4627] with the Client Metadata as top-level members of a JSON object.

The following is a non-normative example response (with line wraps within values for display purposes only):
