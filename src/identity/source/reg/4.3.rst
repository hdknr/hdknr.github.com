4.3.  Client Read Response
------------------------------------

Upon a successful read operation, 
the Authorization Server SHOULD return all registered Metadata about this Client, 
including any fields provisioned by the Authorization Server itself. 

Note that some values, 
including the :term:`client_secret` value, 
might have been updated since the initial registration. 

The mechanisms for such updates are beyond the scope of this specification. 
However, 
since Read operations are intended to be idempotent, 
the Client Read Request itself SHOULD NOT cause changes to the Client's registered Metadata values.

The Authorization Server need not include the :term:`registration_access_token` 
or :term:`registration_client_uri` value in this response 
unless they have been updated.

    .. note::
        - 登録URLやトークンの変更が無かったら返答するな

A successful response SHOULD use the HTTP 200 OK status code 
and return a JSON document [RFC4627] 
using the **application/json** content type 
with the Client Metadata values as top-level members of the root JSON object.

The following is a non-normative example read response 
(with line wraps within values for display purposes only):
