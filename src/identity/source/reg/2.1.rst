2.1.  Metadata Languages and Scripts
---------------------------------------

Human-readable Client Metadata values and Client Metadata values that reference human-readable values MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts. For example, values such as client_name, tos_uri, policy_uri, logo_uri, and client_uri might have multiple locale-specific values in some Client registrations.

To specify the languages and scripts, BCP47 [RFC5646] language tags are added to Client Metadata member names, delimited by a # character. The same syntax is used for representing languages and scripts for Client Metadata as is used for Claims, as described in Section 2.5.2 (Claims Languages and Scripts) of OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages].

If such a human-readable field is sent without a language tag, parties using it MUST NOT make any assumptions about the language, character set, or script of the string value, and the string value MUST be used as-is wherever it is presented in a user interface. To facilitate interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that any human-readable fields sent without language tags contain values suitable for display on a wide variety of systems.
