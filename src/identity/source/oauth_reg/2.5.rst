2.5. Rotate Secret Request
------------------------------------

This operation allows the client to rotate its current Client Secret,
if it has one.  If the client has not been issued a Client Secret,
this operation is an error. [[ Editor's note: could this request be
used to rotate the Registration Access Token, even when there's not a
client_secret?  Should something else be used to rotate the token
independently?  This is an open issue. ]]

   operation  REQUIRED.  MUST have the value rotate_secret

   access_token  REQUIRED.  The Registration Access Token that was
      issued during the client_associate step, or previous client_update
      or rotate_secret calls.

Following is a non-normative example request (with line wraps for
display purposes only):

::

   POST /register HTTP/1.1
   Accept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   Host: server.example.com
   Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJ ... fQ.8Gj_-sj ... _X

   operation=rotate_secret
