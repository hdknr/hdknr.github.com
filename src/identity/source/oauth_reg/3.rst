3. Client Metadata
-----------------------------------


Clients generally have an array of metadata associated with their
unique Client Identifier at the Authorization Server.  These can
range from human-facing display strings, such as a client name, to
items that impact the security of the protocol,

Extensions and profiles of this specification MAY expand this list,
but MUST at least accept all parameters on this list.  The
Authorization Server MUST ignore any additional parameters sent by
the Client that it does not understand.

.. glossary::

   redirect_uris
      REQUIRED A space-delimited list of redirect URIs.

   client_name  RECOMMENDED.  Human-readable name of the Client to be
      presented to the user.

   client_url
      RECOMMENDED.  This field contains the URL of the homepage of the
      client.

   logo_url  
      OPTIONAL.  A URL that references a logo for the Client
      application.  If present, the server SHOULD display this image to
      the end user during approval.

   contacts  
      OPTIONAL.  Space delimited list of email addresses for
      people allowed to administer the information for this Client.
      This is used by some providers to enable a web UI to modify the
      Client information.

   tos_url  
      OPTIONAL.  URL that points to a human-readable Terms of
      Service for the Client.  The Authorization Server SHOULD display
      this URL to the End-User if it is given.

   token_endpoint_auth_method  
      OPTIONAL.  The requested authentication
      type for the Token Endpoint.  The options are
      "client_secret_post", "client_secret_basic", "client_secret_jwt",
      and "private_key_jwt".  Other Authentication methods may be
      defined by extension.  If unspecified or omitted, the default is
      "client_secret_basic" HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme as
      specified in Section 2.3.1 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0]. [[ this list
      of terms needs to be expanded and fully defined, especially in
      reference to signed-jwt client authentication ]]

   policy_url  
      OPTIONAL.  A URL location that the Client provides to the
      End-User to read about the how the profile data will be used.  The
      Authorization Server SHOULD display this URL to the End-User if it
      is given.

   jwk_url  
      OPTIONAL.  URL for the Client's JSON Web Key [JWK] document
      that is used for signing Token Endpoint Requests.  If
      jwk_encryption_url is not provided, the key at jwk_url is also
      used as the key to encrypt responses to the Client.  If the Client
      registers both "x509_url" and "jwk_url", the keys contained in
      both formats MUST be the same.

   jwk_encryption_url  
      OPTIONAL.  URL for the Client's JSON Web Key
      [JWK] that is used to encrypt any responses to the Client.  If the
      Client registers both "jwk_encryption_url" and
      "x509_encryption_url", the keys contained in both formats MUST be
      the same.

   x509_url  
      OPTIONAL.  URL for the Client's PEM encoded X.509
      Certificate or Certificate chain that is used for signing Token
      Endpoint Requests.  If "x509_encryption_url" is not provided,
      "x509_url" it is also used to encrypt responses to the Client.  If
      the Client registers both "x509_url" and "jwk_url", the keys
      contained in both formats MUST be the same.


   x509_encryption_url  
      OPTIONAL.  URL for the Client's PEM encoded
      X.509 Certificate or Certificate chain that is used to encrypt the
      ID Token and User Info Endpoint Responses to the Client.  If the
      Client registers both "jwk_encryption_url" and
      "x509_encryption_url", the keys contained in both formats SHOULD
      be the same.

   require_signed_request_object  
      OPTIONAL.  The JWS [JWS] "alg"
      algorithm [JWA] that MUST be required by the Authorization Server.
      The valid values are listed in Section 3.1 of JWA [JWA].  Servers
      SHOULD support "RS256".

   default_max_age  
      OPTIONAL. (default max authentication age): Type:
      Integer - Specifies that the End-User must be actively
      authenticated if any present authentication is older than the
      specified number of seconds.  (The "max_age" request parameter
      corresponds to the OpenID 2.0 PAPE "max_auth_age" request
      parameter.)  The "max_age" claim in the request object overrides
      this default value.

   default_acr  
      OPTIONAL. (default authentication context class
      reference): Type: String - Specifies the default value that the
      Authorization server must use for processing requests from this
      client.  The "acrs_supported" element of discovery contains a list
      of the supported "acr" values for this server.  The "acr" claim in
      the request object overrides this default value.
