1.3.1. The client needs to be uniquely identifiable by the authorization server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    - Unique identifier for each Client
    - issued by Authorization Server

In order for an authorization server 
to do proper user-delegated authorization and 
prevent unauthorized access 
it must be able to identify clients uniquely.  

As is done today in OAuth, 
the client identifier (and optional secret) should thus be issued 
by the authorization server and 
not simply accepted as proposed by the client.
