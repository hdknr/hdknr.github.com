2.6. Rotate Secret Response
------------------------------------


Upon successful rotation of the client secret, the Client
Registration Endpoint returns a JSON document with the following
fields as top-level members of the root JSON object.


   client_id  REQUIRED.  The unique Client identifier, MUST NOT be
      currently valid for any other registered Client.

   client_secret  REQUIRED.  The Client secret.  This MUST be unique for
      each "client_id".

   registration_access_token  REQUIRED The Access token to be used by
      the client to perform subsequent "client_update" and
      "rotate_secret" requests.

   issued_at
      OPTIONAL.  Specifies the timestamp when the identifier was issued.
      The timestamp value MUST be a positive integer.  The value is
      expressed in the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00
      GMT.

   expires_at  OPTIONAL.  The number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z
      as measured in UTC that the "client_secret" will expire or "0" if
      they do not expire.  See RFC 3339 [RFC3339] for details regarding
      date/times in general and UTC in particular.

Following is a non-normative example response:
