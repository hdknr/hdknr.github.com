1.3.4. Dynamic client registration must be possible from both web-server applications and applications with other capabilities and limitations, such as native applications
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::
    - for smart client registration

Each instance of a native application 
(that is, the specific instance running on each device) 
that is installed and run by the same user may need the option of getting a unique client identifier.  

In this case, 
there are implications around gathering and displaying enough information 
to ensure that the end-user is delegating authorization to the intended application.  

The registration protocol should be simple and flexible 
enough to allow for multiple types of applications.
