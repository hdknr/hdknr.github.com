2.4. Client Update Response
------------------------------------


Upon successful update, the Client Registration Endpoint returns a
JSON document with the following fields as top-level members of the
root JSON object.

   client_id  REQUIRED.  The unique Client identifier, MUST NOT be
      currently valid for any other registered Client.

Following is a non-normative example response:

::

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
    "client_id":"s6BhdRkqt3",
   }

[[ Editor's note: should this return the entire client data object,
for confirmation and review, including any fields that may have been
asserted by the AS? ]]
