2.7. Client Registration Error Response
--------------------------------------------------


When an OAuth error condition occurs, the Client Registration
Endpoint returns an Error Response as defined in Section 5.2 of the
OAuth 2.0 specification.

When a registration error condition occurs, the Client Registration
Endpoint returns a HTTP 400 status code including a JSON object
describing the error in the response body.

The JSON object contains two members:

   error  The error code, a single ASCII string.

   error_description  The additional text description of the error for
      debugging.

   This specification defines the following error codes:

   invalid_operation  The value of "operation" is invalid or not
      supported.

   invalid_redirect_uri  The value of one or more "redirect_uris" is
      invalid.

   invalid_client_metadata  The value of one of the client metadata
      (Section 3) fields is invalid.

Following is a non-normative example of an error response:

::

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json
    Cache-Control: no-store
    
    {
     "error":"invalid_operation",
     "error_description":"The value of the operation parameter must be one of client_associate, rotate_secret or client_update."
    }
