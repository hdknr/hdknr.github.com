1. Introduction
==========================================


In some use-case scenarios, 
it is desirable or necessary to allow OAuth clients 
to obtain authorization from an OAuth :term:`authorization server` 
without the two parties having previously interacted.

Nevertheless, 
in order for the authorization server 
to accurately represent to end-users 
which client is seeking authorization to access the end-user's resources, 
a method for automatic and unique registration of clients is needed.  
The OAuth2 authorization framework does not define 
how the relationship between the Client and the Authorization Server is initialized, 
or how a given client is assigned a unique Client Identifier.  
Historically, 
this has happened out-of-band from the OAuth protocol.  
This draft provides a mechanism for a client to register itself 
with the Authorization Server, 
which can be used to dynamically provision a Client Identifier, 
and optionally a Client Secret.

As part of the registration process, 
this specification also defines a mechanism 
for the client to present the Authorization Server 
with a set of meta information, 
such as a display name and icon to be presented 
to the user during the authorization step.  

This draft provides a method for the client 
to register and update this information over time.
