1. Introduction
========================

This informal draft discusses a number of requirements for 
and approaches to automatic registration of clients 
with an OAuth authorization server, 
with special emphasis 
on the needs of the :doc:`OAuth-based User-Managed Access protocol [UMA-Core] <uma_core>`.

In some use-case scenarios 
it is desirable or necessary to allow OAuth clients 
to obtain authorization from an OAuth authorization server 
without the two parties having previously interacted.
Nevertheless, 
in order for the authorization server to accurately represent 
to end-users which client is seeking authorization 
to access the end-user's resources, 
a method for automatic and unique registration of clients is needed.

The goal of this proposed registration protocol is for 
an :term:`authorization server` to provide a client 
with a :term:`client identifier` 
and optionally a :term:`client secret` in a dynamic fashion.  
To accomplish this,
the authorization server must first be provided with information about the client, 
with the client-name being the minimal information provided.  
In practice, 
additional information will need to be furnished 
to the authorization server, 
such as the client's homepage, icon, description, and so on.

The dynamic registration protocol proposed here is envisioned to be
an additional task to be performed by the OAuth authorization server,
namely registration of a new client identifier and optional secret
and the issuance of this information to the client.  
This task would occur prior to the point at which the client wields its identifier
and secret at the authorization server in order 
to obtain an access token in normal OAuth fashion.
