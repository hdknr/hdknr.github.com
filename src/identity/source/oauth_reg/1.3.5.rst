.. note::
    - Synchronization in big server system

When a client sends information to a server endpoint, 
it might take time for this data to propagate through big server installations 
that spread across various data centers.  

Care needs to be taken that subsequent interactions 
with the user after the registration process,
such as an authorization request, show the correct data.
