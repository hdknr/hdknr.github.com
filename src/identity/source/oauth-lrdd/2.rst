2. Terminology
=================================

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms used in the OAuth
2 and OAuth 1.0a specifcations.  OAuth uses the term "endpoint"
instead of "entry point", this document will generlaly use the term
"entry point" unless an OAuth specific term is needed.
