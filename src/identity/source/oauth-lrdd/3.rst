3. OAuth 2 Link Relation Types
=================================

OAuth 2 [RFC6749] defines two entry points 
which a site or domain might need to advertize.  

These are the user :term:`authorization endpoint`
(usually expected to be a web page the user interacts with) and the
:term:`token endpoint` used for obtaining tokens used to access protected resources.  

These are described in detail in :ref:`Section 3 of the OAuth 2 specification <oauth.3>`.
