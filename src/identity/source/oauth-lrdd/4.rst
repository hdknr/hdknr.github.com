4. OAuth 1.0a Link Relation Types
================================================


   The OAuth 1.0a [RFC5849] protocol defines three entry points that a
   site supporting OAuth 1.0a might advertize: the request initiation
   endpoint, the authorization endpoint, and the token endpoint.  These
   are descibed in detail in Section 2 of the OAuth 1.0a specification.

4.1. The "oauth-initiate" Link Relation Type
------------------------------------------------------


   The OAuth 1.0a entry point used to initiate the sequence, this short
   lived request is what the user approves to grant access to the
   resource.

4.2. The "oauth-authorize" Link Relation Type
------------------------------------------------------


   The OAuth 1.0a authorization entry point used to approve an access
   request.  This is expected to be a user facing web interface.

4.3. The "oauth-token" Link Relation Type
------------------------------------------------------


   The OAuth 1.0a token API entry point used to exchange an approved
   access request for a token, used by the client once the resource
   owner has approved the access request.
