------------------------------------------------------------------


The OAuth 2 token endpoint to be used for obtaining tokens to access
protected services.  This link type has two link-extensions:


.. glossary::

      grant-types

         :  A **space separated list** of OAuth 2 grant types 

         (see :ref:`section 4 <oauth.4>` of :term:`[RFC6749]`) 
         that can be used at the token endpoint to obtain a token.  

         This is not an exclusive list, 
         it provides a hint to the application of what SHOULD be valid.  

         A token endpoint MAY support additional grant types not advertised by a
         discovery service.  

         The client MAY use this to determine the grant types available for use.

      token-types

         :  A space separated list of OAuth 2 token types (see
         :ref:`section 7.1 <oauth.7.1>` of :term:`[RFC6749]`) that 
         may be issued by the token endpoint.  

         It is possible for a token endpoint to issue multiple tokens, 
         and types may vary based on scope or other factors.  

         This is not an exclusive list, 
         it provides a hint to the application of what SHOULD be valid, 
         and it MAY be used by a client to determine 
         if the client supports one or more of the token type(s) available.
