1.  Introduction
========================

Existing Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes that enable interaction with, 
or that identify resources associated with, 
a user's account at a service provider are tied to particular services or application protocols.  

Two examples are the '**mailto**' scheme 
(which enables interaction with a user's email account) 
and the '**http**' scheme 
(which enables retrieval of web files controlled by a user 
or interaction with interfaces providing information about a user).  

However, 
there exists no URI scheme that generically identifies a user's account 
at a service provider without specifying a particular protocol 
to use when interacting with the account.  
This specification fills that gap.
