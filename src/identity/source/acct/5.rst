5.  Security Considerations
==============================

Because the 'acct' URI scheme does not directly enable interaction
with a user's account at a service provider, 
direct security concerns are minimized.

However, an 'acct' URI does provide proof of existence of the account; 
this implies that harvesting published 'acct' URIs could
prove useful to spammers and similar attackers, 
for example if they can use an 'acct' URI to leverage more information 
about the account (e.g., via WebFinger) 
or if they can interact with protocol-specific URIs 
(such as 'mailto' URIs) 
whose user@host portion is the same as that of the 'acct' URI.

In addition, protocols that make use of 'acct' URIs are responsible
for defining security considerations related to such usage, e.g., the
risks involved in dereferencing an 'acct' URI, the authentication and
authorization methods that could be used to control access to
personal data associated with a user's account at a service, and
methods for ensuring the confidentiality of such information.

The use of percent-encoding allows a wider range of characters in
account names, but introduces some additional risks.  Implementers
are advised to disallow percent-encoded characters or sequences that
would (1) result in space, null, control, or other characters that
are otherwise forbidden, (2) allow unauthorized access to private
data, or (3) lead to other security vulnerabilities.
