3.  Rationale
========================

.. note::
    理論的根拠、原理原則

During formalization of the :doc:`WebFinger <doc>` protocol
:term:`[I-D.ietf-appsawg-webfinger]`, 
much discussion occurred regarding the appropriate URI scheme 
to include when specifying a user's account as a :rfc:`web link <5988>` :term:`[RFC5988]`.  

Although both the 'mailto' [RFC6068] and 'http' [RFC2616] schemes were proposed, 
not all service providers offer email services 
or web interfaces on behalf of user accounts
(e.g., a microblogging or instant messaging provider might not offer
email services, or an enterprise might not offer HTTP interfaces to
information about its employees).  

Therefore, 
the participants in the discussion recognized 
that it would be helpful to define a URI scheme 
that could be used to generically identify a user's account 
at a service provider, 
irrespective of the particular application protocols 
used to interact with the account.  
The result was the 'acct' URI scheme defined in this document.

(Note that a user is not necessarily a human; it could be an
automated application such as a bot, a role-based alias, etc.
However, an 'acct' URI is always used to identify something that has
an account at a service, not the service itself.)
