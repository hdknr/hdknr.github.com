7.4.  URI Scheme Semantics
---------------------------------

The 'acct' URI scheme identifies accounts hosted at service providers.  
It is used only for identification, not interaction.  
A protocol that employs the 'acct' URI scheme is responsible for
specifying how an 'acct' URI is dereferenced in the context of that protocol.  
There is no media type associated with the 'acct' URI scheme.
