7.6.  Applications/Protocols That Use This URI Scheme Name
---------------------------------------------------------------------

At the time of this writing, 
only the WebFinger protocol uses the 'acct' URI scheme.  

However, 
use is not restricted to the WebFinger protocol, 
and the scheme might be considered for use in other protocols.
