6.  Internationalization Considerations
============================================

As specified in [RFC3986], the 'acct' URI scheme allows any character
from the Unicode repertoire [UNICODE] encoded as UTF-8 [RFC3629] and
then percent-encoded into valid ASCII [RFC20].  Before applying any
percent-encoding, an application MUST ensure the following about the
string that is used as input to the URI-construction process:

   -  The userpart consists only of Unicode code points that conform to
      the PRECIS IdentifierClass specified in
      [I-D.ietf-precis-framework].

   -  The host consists only of Unicode code points that conform to the
      rules specified in [RFC5892].

   -  Internationalized domain name (IDN) labels are encoded as A-labels
      [RFC5890].
