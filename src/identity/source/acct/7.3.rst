7.3.  URI Scheme Syntax
---------------------------------------

The 'acct' URI syntax is defined here in Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) :term:`[RFC5234]`, 
borrowing the 'host', 'pct-encoded', 'sub-delims', 'unreserved' rules from :term:`[RFC3986]`:

::

   acctURI      =  "acct" ":" userpart "@" host
   userpart     =  unreserved / sub-delims
                   0*( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )

Note that additional rules regarding the strings 
that are used as input to construction of 'acct' URIs further limit the characters
that can be percent-encoded; 
see the Encoding Considerations as well as Section 6 of RFC XXXX.  
[Note to RFC Editor: please replace XXXX with the number issued to this document.]
