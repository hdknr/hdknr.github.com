2.1. Authorization Request Header Field
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When sending the access token in the "Authorization" request header field 
defined by HTTP/1.1, Part 7 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth], 
the client uses the "Bearer" authentication scheme to transmit the access token.

For example:

::

   GET /resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Authorization: Bearer vF9dft4qmT

The "Authorization" header field uses the framework 
defined by HTTP/1.1, Part 7 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth] as follows:

::

   credentials = "Bearer" 1*SP b64token

The b64token syntax was chosen over the alternative #auth-param syntax 
also defined by HTTP/1.1, Part 7 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth]
both for simplicity and for compatibility with existing implementations.  
If additional parameters are needed in the future, 
a different scheme would need to be defined.

Clients SHOULD make authenticated requests 
with a bearer token using the "Authorization" request header field 
with the "Bearer" HTTP authorization scheme.  
Resource servers MUST support this method.
