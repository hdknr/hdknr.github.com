Abstract
===========

This specification describes how to use bearer tokens in HTTP requests 
to access OAuth 2.0 protected resources.  
Any party in possession of a bearer token (a "bearer") can use it 
to get access to the associated resources 
(without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key).  
To prevent misuse, 
bearer tokens need to be protected from disclosure in storage and in transport.
