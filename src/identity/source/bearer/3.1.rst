3.1. Error Codes
----------------------------------------

When a request fails, 
the resource server responds using the appropriate HTTP status code 
(typically, 400, 401, 403, or 405), 
and includes one of the following error codes in the response:

.. glossary::

   invalid_request
         The request is missing a required parameter, includes an
         unsupported parameter or parameter value, repeats the same
         parameter, uses more than one method for including an access
         token, or is otherwise malformed.  The resource server SHOULD
         respond with the HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code.

   invalid_token
         The access token provided is expired, revoked, malformed, or
         invalid for other reasons.  The resource SHOULD respond with
         the HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code.  The client MAY
         request a new access token and retry the protected resource
         request.

   insufficient_scope
         The request requires higher privileges than provided by the
         access token.  The resource server SHOULD respond with the HTTP
         403 (Forbidden) status code and MAY include the "scope"
         attribute with the scope necessary to access the protected
         resource.

If the request lacks any authentication information 
(i.e. the client was unaware,authentication is necessary 
or attempted using an unsupported authentication method), 
the resource server **SHOULD NOT** include an error code or other error information.

For example:

::

   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="example"

(v.21)
