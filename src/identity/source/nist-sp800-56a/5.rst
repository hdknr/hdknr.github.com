5. Cryptographic Elements
====================================

This section describes the basic computations that are performed and the assurances that need to be obtained when performing DLC based key establishment. The schemes described in Section 6 are based upon the correct implementation of these computations and assurances.
Tables 1 and 2 of Section 5.5 list parameter size sets to be used in the selection of cryptographic elements. All cryptographic elements used together shall be selected in accordance with the same parameter size set.
