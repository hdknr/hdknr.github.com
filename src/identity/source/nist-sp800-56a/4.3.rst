4.3 DLC-based Key Transport Process
------------------------------------

Figure 3 depicts the steps that are performed when transporting secret keying material from one entity to another using a key transport scheme. Depending on the available keys, either entity could be the key transport sender. Prior to performing key transport, a key-wrapping key is established by using a key agreement process as specified in Section 7. Key confirmation may be performed to obtain assurance that both parties possess the same key-wrapping key. The sender selects secret keying material to be sent to the other entity, wraps the keying material using the key-wrapping key and sends the wrapped keying material to the other entity. The receiving entity
receives the wrapped keying material and unwraps it using the previously established key- wrapping key.
