5.5.1.2 ECC Domain Parameter Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Domain parameters for ECC schemes are of the form (q, FR, a, b{, SEED}, G, n, h), where q is the field size; FR is an indication of the basis used; a and b are two field elements that define the equation of the curve; SEED is an optional bit string that is included if the elliptic curve was randomly generated in a verifiable fashion; G is a generating point (possibly generated from the SEED) consisting of (xG, yG) of prime order on the curve; n is the order of the point G; and h is the cofactor (which is equal to the order of the curve divided by n). Note that the field size q may be either an odd prime p or 2m, where m is a prime.


.. table:: Table 2: ECC Parameter Size Sets


As shown in Table 2, there are five parameter size sets (named EA, EB, EC, ED and EE) for ECC; all the members of a particular set shall be used together. For U.S. government applications, one or more sets shall be selected based on the solution requirements. See the comparable security table in the Recommendation for Key Management [7] to assess the comparable security of any particular parameter size set. The Recommendation for Key Management [7] provides guidance on selecting the appropriate security strength and an appropriate ECC key size.
The five different cofactor maximums each ensure that the subgroup of order n is unique and that cofactor multiplication is reasonably efficient. The ECC domain parameters shall either be generated as specified in ANS X9.62 [13] or selected from the recommended elliptic curve domain parameters specified in FIPS 186-3 [3]. (Note: ANS X9.62, rather than ANS X9.63, specifies the most current method of generating ECC domain parameters at the time of writing this Recommendation.)
