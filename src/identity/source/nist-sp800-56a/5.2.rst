5.2 Message Authentication Code (MAC) Algorithm
----------------------------------------------------

A Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm defines a family of one-way (MAC) functions that is parameterized by a symmetric key. In key establishment schemes, an entity is sometimes required to compute a MacTag on received or derived data using the MAC function determined by a symmetric key derived from a shared secret. The MacTag is sent to another entity in order to confirm that the shared secret was correctly computed. An Approved MAC algorithm shall be used to compute a MacTag, for example, HMAC [5].

The MAC algorithm is used to provide key confirmation as specified in this Recommendation when key confirmation is desired, and is used to validate implementations of the key establishment schemes specified in this Recommendation (see Section 5.2.3). MacTag computation and checking are defined in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 of this Recommendation.
