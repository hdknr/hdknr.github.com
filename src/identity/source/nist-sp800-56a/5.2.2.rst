5.2.2 MacTag Checking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To check a received MacTag (e.g., received during key confirmation and/or implementation validation), a new MacTag is computedâ€”using the values of MacKey, MacLen, and MacData possessed by the recipient (as specified in Section 5.2.1). The new MacTag is compared with the received MacTag. If their values are equal, then it may be inferred that the same MacKey, MacLen, and MacData values were used in the two MacTag computations.
