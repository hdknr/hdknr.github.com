5.4 Nonces
---------------------

A nonce is a time-varying value that has (at most) a negligible chance of repeating. For example, a nonce may be composed of one (or more) of the following components:

1. A random value that is generated anew for each nonce, using an Approved random bit generator. The security strength of the random bit generator and the entropy of the nonce shall be at least one half of the minimum required bit length of the subgroup order (as specified in Tables 1 and 2 of Section 5.5). A nonce containing a component of this type is called a random nonce.
2. A timestamp of sufficient resolution (detail) so that it is different each time it is used.
3. A monotonically increasing sequence number, or
4. A combination of a timestamp and a monotonically increasing sequence number such that the sequence number is reset only when the timestamp changes. (For example, a timestamp may show the date but not the time of day, so a sequence number is appended that will not repeat during a particular day.)

Nonces are used, for example, in implementation validation testing (Section 5.2.3), in C(0, 2) schemes (Section 6.3), and in key confirmation (Section 8).
When using a nonce, a random nonce should be used.
