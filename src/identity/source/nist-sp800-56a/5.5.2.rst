5.5.2 Assurances of Domain Parameter Validity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Secure key establishment depends on the arithmetic validity of the set of domain parameters used by the parties. Each party shall have assurance of the validity of a candidate set of domain parameters. Each party shall obtain assurance that the candidate set of domain parameters is valid in at least one of the following three ways:

1. The party itself generates the set of domain parameters according to the requirements specified in Section 5.5.1.
2. The party performs an explicit domain parameter validation as specified in:
a. FIPS 186-3 for FFC based on a parameter size set selected from Table 1.
b. ANS X9.62-2 for ECC.
3. The party has received assurance from a trusted third party (for example, a CA or NIST2) that the set of domain parameters was valid at the time that they were generated by reason of either method 1 or 2 above.

Note: Some domain parameters have been generated using SHA-1, and SHA-1 will be required during their validation. At some time in the future, it is expected that SHA-1 will no longer be an Approved hash function. However, if a set of domain parameters was successfully validated with SHA-1 while it was still an Approved hash function, then those domain parameters will continue to qualify as valid even after the use of SHA-1 is no longer Approved. In particular, this is true of the NIST Recommended Elliptic Curves.
The application performing the key establishment on behalf of the party should determine whether or not to allow key establishment based upon the method(s) of assurance that was used. Such knowledge may be explicitly provided to the application in some manner, or may be implicitly provided by the operation of the application itself.
