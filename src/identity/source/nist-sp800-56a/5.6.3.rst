5.6.3 Assurances of the Possession of a Static Private Key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The security of key agreement schemes that use static key pairs depends on limiting knowledge of the static private keys to those who have been authorized to use them (i.e., their respective owners). In addition to preventing unauthorized entities from gaining access to private keys, it is also important to obtain assurance that authorized users do have access to their correct static private keys.


Assurance of possession requirements for the owner of a static private key are specified in Section 5.6.3.1. Assurance of possession requirements for recipients of a static public key are specified in Section 5.6.3.2.
When assurance of possession of a static private key is obtained, the assurance of the validity of the associated public key shall be obtained either prior to or concurrently with obtaining assurance of possession. Note that as time passes, an owner may lose possession of the associated private key, either by choice or due to an error; for this reason, current assurance of possession can be of more value for some applications. See Section 5.6.3.2.2 and Section 8.1 for ways to obtain more current assurance of possession.
