5.2.1 MacTag Computation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The computation of the MacTag is represented as follows:

::

    MacTag = MAC(MacKey, MacLen, MacData).

The MacTag computation shall be performed using an Approved MAC algorithm. In the above equation, MAC represents an Approved MAC algorithm; MacKey represents a symmetric key obtained from the DerivedKeyingMaterial (see Section 5.8); MacLen represents the length of MacTag; and MacData represents the data on which the MacTag is computed. The minimum for MacLen is specified in Tables 1 and 2 of Section 5.5. The minimum size for MacKey is also specified in Tables 1 and 2. See [5] and [6].
