5.6.3.2.1 Recipient Obtains Assurance through a Trusted Third Party
####################################################################################

The recipient of a static public key may receive assurance that its owner is in possession of the correct static private key from a trusted third party, either before or during a key agreement transaction that makes use of that static public key. The methods used by a third party trusted by the recipient to obtain that assurance are beyond the scope of this Recommendation (see however, Section 8.1.5.1.1.2 of SP 800-57 [7]). The recipient of a static public key (or agents trusted to act on behalf of the recipient) should know the method(s) used by the third party, in order to determine that the assurance obtained on behalf of the recipient is sufficient and appropriate to meet the security requirements of the recipientâ€™s intended application(s).
