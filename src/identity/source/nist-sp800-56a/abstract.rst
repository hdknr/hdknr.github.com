This Recommendation specifies key establishment schemes 
using discrete logarithm cryptography, based on standards developed 
by the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X9, Inc.: 
ANS X9.42 (Agreement of Symmetric Keys Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography) and 
ANS X9.63 (Key Agreement and Key Transport Using Elliptic Curve Cryptography).

KEY WORDS: 
 assurances;
 Diffie-Hellman;
 elliptic curve cryptography;
 finite field cryptography;
 key agreement;
 key confirmation;
 key derivation;
 key establishment;
 key management;
 key recovery;
 key transport;
 MQV.
