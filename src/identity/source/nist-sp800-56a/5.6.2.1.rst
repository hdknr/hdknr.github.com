5.6.2.1 Owner Assurances of Static Public Key Validity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The owner of a static public key shall obtain assurance of its validity in one or more of the following ways:

1. Owner Full Validation - The owner performs a successful full public key validation (see Sections 5.6.2.4 and 5.6.2.5). For example, a key generation routine may perform full public key validation as part of its processing.
2. TTP Full Validation – The owner receives assurance that a trusted third party (trusted by the owner) has performed a successful full public key validation (see Sections 5.6.2.4 and 5.6.2.5).
3. Owner Generation – The owner has generated the public key from the private key (see Section 5.6.1).
4. TTP Generation – The owner has received assurance that a trusted third party (trusted by the owner) has generated the public/private key pair and has provided the key pair to the owner (see Section 5.6.1).

The application performing the key establishment on behalf of the owner should determine whether or not to allow key establishment based upon the method(s) of assurance that was used. Such knowledge may be explicitly provided to the application in some manner, or may be implicitly provided by the operation of the application itself. Note that the use of a TTP to generate a key pair for an owner means that the TTP is trusted (by both the owner and any recipient) to not use the owner’s private key to masquerade as the owner.
