    Approved
        FIPS approved or NIST Recommended. 

        An algorithm or technique that is either 
        1) specified in a FIPS or NIST Recommendation, or 
        2) adopted in a FIPS or NIST Recommendation and specified either 
        (a) in an appendix to the FIPS or NIST Recommendation, or 
        (b) in a document referenced by the FIPS or NIST Recommendation.

    Assurance of identifier
        Confidence that identifying information (such as a name) is correctly associated with an entity.

    Assurance of possession of a private key
        Confidence that an entity possesses a private key associated with a public key.

    Assurance of validity
        Confidence that either a key or a set of domain parameters is arithmetically correct.

    Bit length
        The length in bits of a bit string.

    Authority (CA)
        The entity in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) 
        that is responsible for issuing public key certificates 
        and exacting compliance to a PKI policy.

    Cofactor
        The order of the elliptic curve group 
        divided by the (prime) order of the generator point 
        specified in the :term:`domain parameters`.

    Domain parameters
        The parameters used with a cryptographic algorithm 
        that are common to a domain of users.

        (:ref:`nist-sp800-56a.5.5`)

    Entity
        An individual (person), organization, device, or process. “Party” is a synonym.


    Ephemeral key
        A key that is intended for a very short period of use. 

        The key is ordinarily used in exactly one transaction of a cryptographic scheme; 
        an exception to this is 
        when the ephemeral key is used in multiple transactions 
        for a key transport broadcast. 

        Contrast with static key.

    Hash function
        A function that maps a bit string of arbitrary length 
        to a fixed length bit string. 

        Approved hash functions satisfy the following properties:

        1. (One-way) It is computationally infeasible 
           to find any input that maps to any pre-specified output, and

        2. (Collision resistant) It is computationally infeasible 
            to find any two distinct inputs that map to the same output.

        Approved hash functions are specified in FIPS 180-2 [2].


    Identifier
        A bit string that is associated with a person, 
        device or organization. 

        It may be an identifying name, 
        or may be something more abstract 
        (for example, a string consisting of an IP address and timestamp).

        If a party owns a static key pair 
        that is used in a key agreement transaction, 
        then the identifier assigned to that party is one 
        that is bound to that static key pair. 

        If the party does not contribute a static public key 
        as part of a key agreement transaction, 
        then the identifier of that party is a non-null identifier 
        selected in accordance with the protocol utilizing the scheme.

    Initiator
        The party that begins a key agreement transaction. Contrast with responder.

    Key agreement
        A **key establishment procedure** 
        where the resultant secret keying material is 
        a function of information contributed by two participants, 
        so that no party can predetermine the value of the secret keying material 
        independently from the contributions of the other parties. 

        Contrast with key transport.

.. glossary::

   ￼Key agreement transaction
        The instance that results in **shared secret** 
        keying material among different parties 
        using a key agreement scheme.

    Key confirmation
        A procedure to provide **assurance** to one party 
        (the key confirmation recipient) that 
        another party (the key confirmation provider) actually possesses 
        the correct secret keying material and/or shared secret.

    Key derivation
        The process by which keying material is derived 
        from a shared secret and other information.

    Key establishment
        The procedure that results in shared secret keying material 
        among different parties.

    Key establishment transaction
        An instance of establishing secret keying material 
        using a key establishment scheme.

.. glossary::

    ￼Key transport
        A key establishment procedure 
        whereby one party (the sender) selects a value 
        for the secret keying material 
        and then securely distributes that value 
        to another party (the receiver). 

        Contrast with key agreement.

    Key transport transaction
        The instance that results in shared secret keying material 
        between different parties using a key transport scheme.

    Key wrap
        A method of encrypting keying material 
        (along with associated integrity information) 
        that provides both **confidentiality** 
        and **integrity** protection using a symmetric key algorithm.

    Keying material
        The data that is necessary to establish and maintain 
        a cryptographic keying relationship. 

        Some keying material may be secret, 
        while other keying material may be public. 

        As used in this Recommendation, 
        secret keying material may include **keys**, 
        **secret initialization vectors** or other **secret information**; 
        public keying material includes any non-secret data 
        needed to establish a relationship.

    MacTag
        Data that allows an entity to verify the integrity of the information. 

        Other documents sometimes refer to this data as a MAC.

    Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm
        Defines a family of one-way cryptographic functions 
        that is parameterized by a symmetric key and 
        produces a MacTag on arbitrary data. 

        A MAC algorithm can be used to provide data origin authentication 
        as well as data integrity. 

        In this Recommendation, 
        a MAC algorithm is used for key confirmation and validation testing purposes.

    Nonce
        A time-varying value that has at most a negligible chance of repeating, 
        for example, 
        a random value that is generated anew for each use, 
        a timestamp, a sequence number, or some combination of these.

        :ref:`nist-sp800-56a.5.4`

    Owner
        For a static key pair, 
        the owner is the entity that is authorized to use the static private key 
        associated with a public key, 
        whether that entity generated the static key pair itself 
        or a trusted party generated the key pair for the entity. 

        For an :term:`ephemeral key` pair, 
        the owner is the entity that generated the key pair.

    Party
        An individual (person), 
        organization, device, or process. 

        “:term:`Entity”` is a synonym for party.

    Provider
        The party during key confirmation that provides assurance 
        to the other party (the recipient) 
        that the two parties have indeed established a shared secret.

    Public key certificate
        A set of data that contains an entity’s identifier(s), 
        the entity's public key (including an indication of 
        the associated set of domain parameters, if any) 
        and possibly other information, 
        and is digitally signed by a trusted party, 
        thereby binding the public key to the included identifier(s).

    Receiver
        The party that receives secret keying material 
        via a key :term:`transport transaction`. 

        Contrast with :term:`sender`.

    Recipient
        A party that receives 
        (1) keying material: 
        such as a static public key 
        (e.g., in a certificate) or an ephemeral public key; 
        (2) assurance: 
        such as an assurance of the validity of a candidate public key 
        or assurance of possession of the private key 
        associated with a public key; or 
        (3) key confirmation. 

        Contrast with :term:`provider`.

    Responder
        The party that does not begin a key agreement transaction. 

        Contrast with :term:`initiator`.

    Scheme
        A (cryptographic) scheme consists of an unambiguous specification 
        of a set of transformations 
        that are capable of providing a (cryptographic) service 
        when properly implemented and maintained. 

        A scheme is a higher level construct 
        than a primitive and a lower level construct than a protocol.

    Security strength 
    (Also “Bits of security”)
        A number associated with the amount of work 
        (that is, the number of operations) 
        that is required to break a cryptographic algorithm or system.

    Security properties
        The security features 
        (e.g., entity authentication, playback protection, 
        or key confirmation) 
        that a cryptographic scheme may, or may not, provide.

    Sender
        The party that sends secret keying material 
        to the receiver using a key transport transaction.

    Shall
        This term is used to indicate a requirement of 
        a Federal Information processing Standard (FIPS) 
        or a requirement that needs to be fulfilled 
        to claim conformance to this Recommendation. 

        Note that shall may be coupled with not to become shall not.

    Shared secret keying material
        The secret keying material that is either 
        (1) **derived** by applying the key derivation function 
        to the shared secret and other shared information 
        during a key agreement process, or 
        (2) is **transported** during a key transport process.

    Shared secret
        A secret value that has been computed 
        using a key agreement scheme 
        and is used as input to a key derivation function.

    ￼Should
        This term is used to indicate an important recommendation. 

        Ignoring the recommendation could result in undesirable results. 

        Note that should may be coupled with not to become should not.

    Static key
        A key that is intended for use 
        for a **relatively long period of time** and 
        is typically intended for use in many instances 
        of a cryptographic key establishment scheme. 

        Contrast with an :term:`ephemeral key`.
        ￼
    Symmetric key algorithm
        A cryptographic algorithm   
        that uses one secret key that is **shared** 
        between authorized parties.

    Trusted party
        A trusted party is a party that is trusted by an entity 
        to faithfully perform certain services for that entity. 

        An entity may choose to act as a trusted party for itself.

    third party
        A third party, such as a CA,
        that is trusted by its clients to perform certain services. 

        (By contrast, the initiator and responder in a scheme 
        are considered to be the first 
        and second parties in a key establishment transaction.)
