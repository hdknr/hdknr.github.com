Discrete Logarithm Cryptography (DLC), 
which includes Finite Field Cryptography (FFC) 
and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), 
requires that the public and private key pairs be generated 
with respect to a particular set of domain parameters. 


A candidate set of domain parameters is said to be valid 
when it conforms to all the requirements specified in this Recommendation. 

A user of a candidate set of domain parameters 
(for example, either an initiator or a responder) 
shall have assurance of domain parameter validity 
prior to using them. 

Although domain parameters are public information, 
they shall be managed so that the correct correspondence 
between a given key pair and its set of domain parameters is maintained 
for all parties that use the key pair. 

Domain parameters may remain fixed for an extended time period, 
and one set of domain parameters may be used 
with multiple key pairs and with multiple key establishment schemes.

Some schemes in ANS X9.42 and X9.63 allow the set of domain parameters used and associated with static keys to be different from the set of domain parameters used and associated with ephemeral keys. 

For this Recommendation, however, only one set of domain parameters shall be used during any key establishment transaction using a given run of a scheme (that is, the static- key domain parameters and the ephemeral-key domain parameters used in one scheme shall be the same).
