5.6.2.4 FFCFullPublicKeyValidationRoutine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FFC full public key validation refers to the process of checking all the arithmetic properties of a candidate FFC public key to ensure that it has the unique correct representation in the correct subgroup (and therefore is also in the correct multiplicative group) of the finite field specified by the associated FFC domain parameters. FFC full public key validation does not require knowledge of the associated private key and so may be done at any time by anyone. This method shall be used with static and ephemeral FFC public keys when assurance of the validity of the keys is obtained by method 1 or method 2 of Sections 5.6.2.1, 5.6.2.2, and 5.6.2.3.

Input:
1. (p, q, g{, SEED, pgenCounter}): A valid set of FFC domain parameters, and
2. y: A candidate FFC public key.

Process:
1. Verify that 2 ≤ y ≤ p-2.
(Ensures that the key has the unique correct representation and range in the field.)
2. Verify that yq = 1 (mod p).
(Ensures that the key has the correct order and is in the correct subgroup.)
Output: If any of the above checks fail, then output an error indicator. Otherwise, output an indication of successful full validation.
