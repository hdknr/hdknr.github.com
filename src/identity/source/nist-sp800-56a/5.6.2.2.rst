5.6.2.2 RecipientAssurancesofStaticPublicKeyValidity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recipient of a static public key shall obtain assurance of its validity in one or more of the following ways:

1. Recipient Full Validation - The recipient performs a successful full public key validation (see Sections 5.6.2.4 and 5.6.2.5).
2. TTP Full Validation – The recipient receives assurance that a trusted third party (trusted by the recipient) has performed a successful full public key validation (see Sections 5.6.2.4 and 5.6.2.5).
3. TTP Generation – The recipient receives assurance that a trusted third party (trusted by the recipient) has generated the public/private key pair in accordance with Section 5.6.1 and has provided the key pair to the owner.

The application performing the key establishment on behalf of the recipient should determine whether or not to allow key establishment based upon the method(s) of assurance that was used. Such knowledge may be explicitly provided to the application in some manner, or may be implicitly provided by the operation of the application itself. Note that the use of a TTP to generate a key means that the TTP is trusted (by both the recipient and the owner) to not use the owner’s private key to masquerade as the owner.
