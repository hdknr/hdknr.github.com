5.2.3 Implementation Validation Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For purposes of validating an implementation of the schemes in this Recommendation during an implementation validation test (under the NIST Cryptographic Validation Program), the value of MacData shall be the string “Standard Test Message”, followed by a 16-byte field for a nonce. The default value for this field is all binary zeros. Different values for this field will be specified during testing. This is for the purposes of testing when no key confirmation capability exists (see Section 10).
Note: ANS X9.42 defines MacData as “ANSI X9.42 Testing Message”. ANS X9.63 does not address implementation validation at this level of detail. The implementation test message used for NIST validation is a different text string from the implementation test message for ANS X9.42 validation.
