5.6.1.1 FFC Key Pair Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the FFC schemes, each static and ephemeral private key and public key shall be generated using an Approved method and the selected valid domain parameters (p, q, g{, SEED, pgenCounter}) (see Appendix B of FIPS 186-3). Each private key shall be unpredictable and shall be generated in the range [1, q-1] using an Approved random bit generator. The static public key y is computed from the static private key x by using the following formula: y = gx mod p. Similarly the ephemeral public key t is computed from the ephemeral private key r by using the following formula: t = gr mod p.
