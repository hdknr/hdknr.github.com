5.6.3.2 Recipient Assurance of Owner’s Possession of a Static Private Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the time of binding an identifier to the owner’s static public key, the binding authority shall obtain assurance that the owner is in possession of the correct static private key. This assurance shall either be obtained using one of the methods specified in Section 5.6.3.2.2 or by using an Approved alternative.
Recipients other than binding authorities shall obtain this assurance – either through a trusted third party (see Section 5.6.3.2.1) or directly – before using the derived keying material for purposes beyond those required during the key agreement transaction itself. If the recipient chooses to obtain this assurance directly, then to comply with this Recommendation the parties shall use one of the methods specified in Section 5.6.3.2.2.
