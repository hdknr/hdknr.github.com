Abstract
=========

The JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization (JWS-JS) is 
a means of representing content secured with digital signatures 
or Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs) 
using JSON data structures. 

This specification describes a means of representing secured content 
as a JSON data object 
(as opposed to the JWS specification, 
which uses a compact serialization with a URL-safe representation). 
It enables multiple digital signatures and/or HMACs to be applied to the same content (unlike JWS). 
Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers used with this specification are enumerated 
in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (:doc:`JWA <jwa>`) specification. 

The JSON Serialization for related encryption functionality 
is described in the separate JSON Web Encryption JSON Serialization (JWE-JS) specification.
