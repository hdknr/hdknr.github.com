2.1 Distinguishing Software Endpoints from Legally Responsible Parties
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because software is just a tool 
and can’t be held legally responsible for its own actions, 
and because :term:`UMA` has a goal of setting legally enforceable conditions 
for access authorization to resources, 
we acknowledge the importance of the natural persons (human beings) 
and legal persons (such as companies) that run, control, own, contract to use, etc. 
UMA-compliant software. 
Let’s refer to these as parties to distinguish them 
from protocol endpoints, 
and name the corresponding UMA parties as follows:

    - :term:`Authorizing user` --- the natural person seeking to protect resources stored at the host

        - "Authorizing user" is used instead of the more generic "authorizing party" 
          because the scope of UMA's initial version focuses primarily on humans acting 
          on their own behalf on the Web, 
          rather than companies or other legal persons

    - Host operator --- the natural or legal person responsible for the running host service
    - Authorization manager operator (AM operator) – the natural or legal person responsible for the running AM service
    - Requesting party --- the natural or legal person seeking access to protected resources
