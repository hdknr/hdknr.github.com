2.3. UMA Trust Relationships
--------------------------------------------

The really interesting question is: 

If something goes wrong, 
will it be possible to assign responsibility accurately? 

For example, 
if Alice sets policies that she thinks will prevent Zeke from seeing her calendar, 
and Zeke gets access somehow through some requester client app, 
who exactly was at fault? 
Since UMA imposes a very loose coupling between the setting of :term:`policy`, 
the application of policy in assigning authorizations, 
and the providing of resources, 
a lot could go wrong. 
The act of authorization has to be made meaningful through making different parties' actions enforceable and auditable.

The baseline behavior expectations of all UMA parties are summarized in the following diagram, 
and elucidated in the following sections. 
Here's how to read this diagram. 
When party A relies on party B to do something, 
this means party A has a reasonable expectation that party B will do it. 
Depending on actual legal arrangements between them, 
this might or might not rise to the level of a liability on party B's part.

Note that 
various deployments of online services might impose additional "special terms" 
beyond the "general terms" imposed by the use of the :doc:`UMA core protocol <uma_core>`. 
Such services might specify these terms in technical profiles of the UMA specification, 
in contractual form, or both.
