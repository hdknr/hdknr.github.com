2.3.2. The Trust Relationships Among the Authorizing User, AM Operator, and Host Operator Formed by Their Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the set of trust relationships formed in :term:`UMA phase 1`, 
when the user introduces a :term:`host` and :term:`AM` to work together in protecting resources. 
The user will likely introduce many :term:`hosts` to the same :term:`AM`. 
In some cases, 
particular :term:`hosts` may make it possible to protect some resources 
with one :term:`AM` and other resources with a different :term:`AM`.

(A number of pairwise agreements between these parties will likely have been made outside of UMA interactions; 
see :ref:`The Role of Private Agreements for further discussion <uma_trust.2.4>`.)

    *   - TR

        - When is TR formed?  
        - Comments

    *   - U⇾AM(h)     
        - :term:`Authorizing user` relies on :term:`AM operator`  
        - To work with this specific :term:`host operator` 
          in protecting the user's resources hosted here.    
        - In :term:`UMA phase 1`, 
          when the user authorizes the :term:`AM` 
          to issue a :term:`host access token` 
          to this :term:`host` for use at the :term:`AM`'s :term:`protection API`.   
        - Later, 
          in :term:`phases 2` and :term:`3 <phase 3>`, 
          the :term:`AM` will require the :term:`host` to present a valid :term:`access token` 
          whenever it uses the :term:`AM`’s :term:`protection API` 
          on behalf of this user. 
          These authorization and :term:`protected API` mechanisms are purely OAuth-based.

    *   - AM⇾U(h)     
        - :term:`AM operator` relies on :term:`authorizing user`  
        - To introduce the desired :term:`host operator` 
          to this :term:`AM` in outsourcing protection of this :term:`host`'s resources.   
        - In :term:`UMA phase 1`, 
          when the user authorizes the :term:`AM` 
          to issue a :term:`host access token` to this :term:`host` 
          for use at the :term:`AM`'s :term:`protection API`.    
        - 

    *   - U⇾H(am)     
        - :term:`Authorizing user` relies on :term:`host operator`    
        - To participate in the outsourcing of authorization for :term:`protected resources` 
          and to respect the :term:`permissions` generated by the :term:`AM`.  
        - In :term:`UMA phase 1`, 
          when the user authorizes the :term:`AM` to issue a :term:`host access token` 
          to this :term:`host` for use at the :term:`AM`'s :term:`protection API`.   
        - Once the :term:`AM operator` becomes the user’s :term:`authorization proxy`, 
          it begins relying on the :term:`host operator` in other more specific ways. 
          1See the section below.

    *   - H⇾U(am)     
        - :term:`Host operator` relies on :term:`authorizing user`    
        - To introduce the :term:`host` to the desired :term:`AM operator`.   
        - In :term:`UMA phase 1`,   
          when the :term:`user` 
          (having been redirected by the :term:`host` to the :term:`AM` selected by the user) 
          authorizes 
          that :term:`AM` to issue a :term:`host access token` to this :term:`host` 
          for use at the :term:`AM`'s :term:`protection API`.  
        - Once the :term:`AM operator` becomes the user’s :term:`authorization proxy`, 
          the :term:`host operator` begins relying on it in other more specific ways. 
          See the section below.

    *   - AM⇾H(u)     
        - :term:`AM operator` relies on :term:`host operator`     
        - To register :term:`resource sets` and 
          applicable actions accurately 
          according to the user’s wishes for protection/selective sharing.    
        - In :term:`UMA phase 1`, 
          when the :term:`host` engages in :term:`resource registration`.
