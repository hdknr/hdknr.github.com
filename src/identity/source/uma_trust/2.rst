1. Introduction
==============================

:term:`UMA` is a protocol that describes a technical "contract" 
for HTTP-based interactions 
(such as standardized request and response messages involving standardized data formats) 
among compliant software entities. 
The entities fill various roles in order to achieve "user-managed access" to Web resources. 
The following diagram illustrates the high-level goal of UMA.

Software entities participating in a protocol are frequently known as endpoints. The UMA endpoints are:

    - :term:`Authorizing user` (the "user" in User-Managed Access)

        - "User" is often used informally in the UMA spec, 
          where what is really meant is the browser 
         (or other client software application) being operated by this person

    - :term:`Authorization manager` (:term:`AM`)
    - :term:`Host` (of ":term:`protected resources`")
    - :term:`Requester`
