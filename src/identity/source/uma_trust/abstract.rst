Abstract
==========

:doc:`User-Managed Access <uma_core>` (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  

UMA defines how :term:`resource owners` can control :term:`protected-resource` access 
by :term:`clients` operated by arbitrary :term:`requesting parties`, 
where the resources reside on any number of :term:`resource servers`, 
and where a centralized :term:`authorization server` governs access 
based on :term:`resource owner policy`.

This document provides a **contractual framework** that defines the
**minimum obligations** of parties that operate and use 
UMA-conforming software programs and services.  

The goal of this framework is to support **end-to-end legal enforceability** 
of the terms and conditions of access sharing relationships 
between authorizing and requesting sides that use UMA.  

The audience for this document includes technologists, 
legal professionals, and operators of UMA-conforming services.
