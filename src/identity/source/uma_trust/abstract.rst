Abstract
==========

:doc:`User-Managed Access <uma_core>` (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  

UMA defines how resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients
operated by arbitrary requesting parties, where the resources reside
on any number of resource servers, and where a centralized
authorization server governs access based on resource owner policy.

This document provides a **contractual framework** that defines the
**minimum obligations** of parties that operate and use 
UMA-conforming software programs and services.  

The goal of this framework is to support **end-to-end legal enforceability** 
of the terms and conditions of access sharing relationships 
between authorizing and requesting sides that use UMA.  

The audience for this document includes technologists, 
legal professionals, and operators of UMA-conforming services.
