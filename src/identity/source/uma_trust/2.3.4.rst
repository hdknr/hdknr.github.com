2.3.4. The Trust Relationships Between The AM Operator and Requesting Party That Govern Access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The host operator need not trust the requesting party at all, because it outsources the job entirely to the AM operator. 
These trust relationships reflect how the requesting party goes from untrusted to trusted for a particular scope of access, as far as the AM operator (acting as a proxy for the authorizing user) is concerned.

    *   - TR  
        - Who relies on whom?     
        - Expected behavior of the responsible party  
        - When is TR formed?  
        - Comments

    *   - AM⇾R(u)     
        - AM operator relies on requesting party  
        - To truthfully supply any self-asserted claims required for access authorization.    
        - In UMA phase 2, when the AM demands and the requesting party supplies claims.   
        - Where claims are supplied that can be verified by the AM, there is no need for this sort of "reliance". We anticipate finding a way to bind trusted claims about the identity of a "requesting natural person" to subsequent self-asserted claims such as promises to adhere to a data usage agreement. In this way, we can strengthen the enforceability of such promises without having to rely on mere AM operator trust on the requesting party's say-so (or, for that matter, authorizing user trust on the AM operator's say-so).

    *   - R⇾AM(u)     
        - Requesting party relies on AM operator  
        - To request only claims whose supply supports the application of the user's authorization constraints.   
        - In UMA phase 2, when the AM demands and the requesting party supplies claims.   
        - The requesting party has the real-time opportunity to authorize sharing of the demanded claims, but this should not be relied on as the only brake against an AM that over-demands claims.
