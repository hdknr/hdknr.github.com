2.2. Sharing Constellations
----------------------------------------

While the essential end-to-end relationship being managed in UMA 
is the one between the :term:`authorizing user` and the :term:`requesting party`, 
there are subtle variations around the nature of the latter and the nature of the software they might use, 
as illustrated by the following diagram.

Each of these types of :term:`requesting party` and interaction style defines a different sharing constellation. 
Following are examples of each:

    - Person-to-self sharing: 

      This describes most OAuth-mediated access, 
      for example, 
      when Alice introduces the Klout service to her Twitter account. 
      She uses both services herself, 
      and wants them to communicate together on her behalf.

    - Person-to-person sharing: 

      Today, 
      many Web 2.0 sites offer some level of this control, 
      but methods, strengths, and interfaces are inconsistent 
      between sites and we're not able to reuse policies across sites. 

      For example, 
      Alice can share Flickr photos with Bob by adding him to her Flickr "friends" 
      or "family" list or by mailing him a special link to a photo album. 
      Or Alice can add Bob as a "friend" on Facebook.

    - Person-to-organization sharing mediated by a requesting party agent: 

      For example, 
      Alice wants to give her dentist's office temporary access to her calendar, 
      to make it easier to schedule a series of root canal appointments. 
      Carl, the office assistant, might be the actual person acting 
      on behalf of the dentist's practice who sees Alice's calendar.

    - Person-to-organization sharing mediated by an autonomous web service client: 

      For example, 
      Alice has crafted a "personal request for proposals" (RFP) 
      because she's in the market for a new car, 
      and she's willing to let car dealerships in her region of the country see the RFP 
      and make her offers. 
      Different car dealerships might use Web crawler services 
      to go out and collect such RFPs, 
      and these services will have to prove in automated fashion 
      that they legitimately represent the right kind of business.

Each constellation's requirements for successful user-managed access may be distinct. 

For example, 
in person-to-self sharing, 
it's unlikely Alice will want to impose stringent contract terms on herself. 
In person-to-organization sharing, 
if the organization is using a web service client, 
it makes no sense to present a browser-interaction interface to it. 
And if the organization is acting through an agent 
such as a receptionist or administrator, 
that person may need to prove they are acting on behalf of the organization.
