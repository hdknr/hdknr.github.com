15.2.  Message Payloads
--------------------------------

Message payloads are only sent to Backplane Clients 
at :ref:`Privileged Access Level (Privileged Access) <backplane.5.2>`. 
This is in order to allow sensitive data to be exchanged 
among server-side Backplane Clients, 
while not allowing it to reach the less secure context of web browser.

It is therefore important that :ref:`Privileged Access Level (Privileged Access) <backplane.5.2>` 
credentials are not provisioned to Backplane Clients that run in a web browser
