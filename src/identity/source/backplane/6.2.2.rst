6.2.2.  Static Client Registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:term:`Backplane Servers` MAY provide an administrative interface 
through which :term:`Bus Owners` can register :term:`Backplane Clients`. 
The interactions between a :term:`Backplane Server` and its :term:`Bus Owner` customers 
(e.g. registration, authentication, :term:`Bus allocation`) remain outside of the scope of this specification.

.. note::

    :term:`Buses` seems to have to be allocated at :term:`Backplane Server`

For the purpose of Privileged Access Level authorization 
a server-side :term:`Backplane Client` needs to be identified by a URL 
that corresponds to the Redirection URI defined in section 2.1.1 
(Habber-Lahav, E., Recordon, D., and D. Hardt, “The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol,” May 2011.) 
[OAuth2] 
and used in the authorization step in section 4 
(Habber-Lahav, E., Recordon, D., and D. Hardt, “The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol,” May 2011.) 
[OAuth2]. 

The redirection URI MUST be obtained and approved by the :term:`Bus Owner` administrator. 
:term:`Backplane Servers` may assist :term:`Bus Owner` administrators 
by providing the redirection URIs of well known :term:`Backplane Clients` 
(such as popular :term:`Widget` providers) in their administration user interface.

When completing 
a :ref:`Backplane Server Initiated Authorization (Backplane Server Initiated Authorization) <backplane.6.3.2>` 
if the previously unregistered :term:`Backplane Client` opted to also send client credentials, 
the :term:`Backplane Server` MAY :ref:`register (Static Client Registration) <backplane.6.2.2>` 
the :term:`Backplane Client`. 

The Backplane Server MUST verify all of the following:

-   The grant_type is ":term:`code`".
-   The code is present and the value is recognized as a previously issued, one-time use, valid code.
-   The :term:`redirect_uri` is present and matches the redirect_uri for which the supplied :term:`code` was issued.
-   The :term:`client_id` is present and is different than ":term:`anonymous`" or any other already registered client_id.

.. note::
    - OAuth code flow
    - "anonymouse" is special client_id for Wiget

After a successful registration the :term:`Backplane Server` MUST continue processing 
the :ref:`Authenticated Access Token Request (Authenticated Access Token Request) <backplane.13.1.2>` 

(draft 08)
