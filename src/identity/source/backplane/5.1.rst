5.1.  Regular Access
---------------------------

(:term:`Widgets` and the :term:`Backplane JavaScript Library`) 
and are obtained through **anonymous calls** to the :ref:`token (Access Token Request) <backplane.13.1>` endpoint.

:term:`Bus owners` and :term:`Backplane Servers` acting on their behalf 
MUST NOT give authorization credentials for Privileged access level 
to :term:`Backplane Clients` running in the web browser.

(not full :term:`Backplane Messages`) 
available to Clients having Regular access level.
