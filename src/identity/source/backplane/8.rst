8.  Buses
========================

A :term:`Bus` is a **logical grouping** of :term:`Backplane Clients` 
that need to interact with each other, 
typically belonging to one organization. 
:term:`Buses` allow a :term:`Backplane Server` to service multiple customers. 
:term:`Bus names` are short strings referencing the :term:`Bus owner`'s name 
(e.g. "customer.com", "organization.org"). 
:term:`Backplane Clients` must know the identifiers for the :term:`Buses` 
through which they wish to exchange :term:`Backplane Messages`.

It is assumed 
that a relationship of trust exists between all clients 
granted permission to post messages to a specific :term:`Bus` (see :ref:`Trust (Trust) <backplane.4>`).
