.. _Access Levels:

5.  Access Levels
============================

Considering the significantly different security enforcement capabilities 
of applications running in a web browser versus the ones running on a web server, 
two access levels are defined for :term:`Backplane Clients`: 
:ref:`Regular <Regular Access>` and :ref:`Privileged <Privileged Access>`.

Each access level is exercised for retrieving messages 
from the :ref:`Get Messages (Get Messages) <backplane.13.2>` endpoint 
by presenting either a regular or a privileged access token 
obtained from the :term:`token (Access Token Request) <backplane.13.1>` endpoint. 
The access token MUST be presented as described 
:ref:`in section 2.1 <bearer.2.1>` 
(Jones, M., Hardt, D., and D. Recordon, “The OAuth 2.0 Protocol: Bearer Tokens,” Jun 2011.) 
[OAuth2.token.bearer].

:term:`Backplane Servers` MUST validate the access token presented 
with all requests received at the :ref:`Get Messages (Get Messages) <backplane.13.2>` endpoint 
and determine the access level associated with it.
