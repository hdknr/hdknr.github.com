11.1.  Sticky Messages
-------------------------------------------------

Some Backplane application scenarios may require longer lived :term:`Backplane Messages`, 
such as for keeping a shared state about a end user's logged-in identity or profile data.

Support for such scenarios is accomplished by flagging messages as "sticky" 
when they are :ref:`posted (see Post Messages To A Channel (Post Messages)) <backplane.13.4>`. 
:term:`Backplane Servers` MUST retain sticky messages for at least X minutes. 
It is RECOMMENDED that :term:`Backplane Servers` retain sticky messages for Y minutes.

:term:`Backplane Clients` can request retrieval of Backplane Frames 
that only encapsulate sticky messages 
by using the "sticky" :ref:`Access Scope (Access Scopes) <backplane.12.1>` filter. 
See also :ref:`Message Retrieval Conventions (Message Sequences and Retrieval) <backplane.12>` below.

Application scenario protocols MUST specify the criteria for posting sticky messages, 
if any, 
such as defining certain message types or operations as sticky.

Application scenario protocols SHOULD define `sticky messages`_ 
in such a way as to minimize the number of sticky messages 
that may be retained by the :term:`Backplane Server` at any one time for a channel, 
in order to reduce complexity of retrieval 
and processing by the :term:`Backplane Clients` that rely on them.
