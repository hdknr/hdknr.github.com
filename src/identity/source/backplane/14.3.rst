14.3.  Hints
-----------------------------------

For performance reasons the Backplane JavaScript Library polls the Backplane Server with a low frequency (e.g once a minute). Since Backplane events usually are initiated on the client side (e.g. the user clicking a button), Widgets on the page are in a position to hint the library that a Backplane message may be soon delivered. Upon the receipt of such hint (via expectMessagesWithin method), the library temporarily increases the polling frequency (e.g. to once a second) and then gradually decreases it to the default low value one.

The expectMessagesWithin method can accept an optional list of expected message types.

    If the library accepts any message from the passed message types list, 
    it gradually returns to the lower polling frequency mode;

    If messages with only one type are expected, 
    the second argument may be specified as a string;

    Each call of the method adds passed message types to the list of expected message types. 
    In other words, 
    if a user calls the method with a message type "type1" 
    and then performs one more call with a message type "type2", 
    the library will run in the fast polling mode 
    until it received messages of all the types or 
    until the libray reached the maximum allotted waiting time interval.
