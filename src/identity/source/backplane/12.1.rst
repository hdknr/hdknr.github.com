12.1.  Access Scopes
----------------------------------------

The filter criteria for defining a :term:`Message Sequence` are passed 
to the token endpoint when :ref:`requesting access tokens (Access Token Request) <backplane.13.1>` 
as a **space-delimited list** of access scopes in the following format:

::

    Access Scope Format:
        <message_field_name>:<message_field_value> 


where 
**message_field_name** is any of the defined message field names (:term:`Backplane Messages`), 
and **message_field_value** is the expected field's value.

An :term:`access scope` is evaluated by performing a case-sensitive string comparison 
between the expected field's value in the access scope, 
and the field value from the Backplane Message.

A list of access scopes is evaluated as follows:

-   a logical OR operation is performed for all access scopes having the same field name
-   a logical AND operation is performed among all access scopes having different field names

Example access scopes: all sticky messages of type "identity/ack" posted by "http://aboutecho.com" 
to any channel belonging to the "customer.com" bus.

::

    bus:customer.com source:http://aboutecho.com type:identity/ack sticky:true

Example access scopes: all messages (belonging to bus A OR bus B) AND (having type C OR type D)

::

    bus:A bus:B type:C type:D

When issuing or verifying the scope of an access token, 
:term:`Backplane Servers` MUST enforce that the requester is authorized 
with :ref:`Privileged Access (Privileged Access) <backplane.5.2>` for all "bus:" access scopes.

Application scenario protocol extensions MAY define additional authorization requirements 
against other scope type and Backplane Message fields.
