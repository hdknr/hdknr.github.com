5.2.  Privileged Access
-----------------------------------

Privileged access level is given to :term:`Backplane Clients` 
that are **not** running in a web browser 
(typically the :term:`Widgets' server-side components <Widget Server>`) 
and are obtained through authenticated calls to the :ref:`token (Access Token Request) <backplane.13.1>` endpoint.

:term:`Backplane Clients` having Privileged access level can perform the following operations 
on a :term:`Bus` for which they have obtained authorization (Authorization) credentials from the Bus owner:

-    retrieve all Backplane Messages sent to the Bus [[[ xref ]]]
-    post Backplane Messages to a Channel [[[ xref ]]]
