11.  Message Retention
==========================================

.. note::

    - Message retained at Backplane Server  has TTL.
    - "TTL=5(min)" is recommendation. 

:term:`Backplane Servers` MUST maintain a buffer of messages 
received from all their clients 
until messages become older than a certain **threshold**. 

Such threshold MUST be no less than 1 minute. 
It is RECOMMENDED that :term:`Backplane Servers` set the threshold to **at least 5 minutes**. 
A message is considered obsolete once its age reaches the threshold.

It is RECOMMENDED that :term:`Backplane Servers` make messages available 
for retrieval as soon as possible after they are posted.

:term:`Backplane Clients` that require reliable message delivery 
MUST poll their :term:`Backplane Servers` 
with an interval of 30 seconds or less in order to avoid omissions.
