5.2.1.  Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Registered (Backplane Client Registration) :term:`Backplane Clients` must be authorized 
with Privilged Access Level. This can be done in one of the following ways:

-   By :term:`Backplane Server` administrators. 
    It is outside of the scope of this specification 
    how the administrators learn from their customers, 
    the :term:`Bus Owners`, the :term:`Buses` and :term:`Backplane Clients` to be authorized with Privileged Access.

-   By :term:`Bus Owners`, 
    through an administrative interface provided by the :term:`Backplane Server`. 
    The interactions between a :term:`Backplane Server` and its :term:`Bus Owner` customers 
    (e.g. registration, authentication, Bus allocation) remain outside of the scope of this specification.
