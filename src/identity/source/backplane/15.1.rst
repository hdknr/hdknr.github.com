15.1.  Channel Name Sensitivity
--------------------------------------------

The Channel Name acts as a session identifier shared among a group of trusted parties. Knowledge of a Channel Name offers Regular Access level to Backplane Server API.

It is therefore important that the Channel Name is not compromised, by either:

    - Trusting any third-party JavaScript source included in the Web Page without due verification, or

    - Disclosing Channel Names to untrusted parties.
