7.  Padded Responses
================================

For API requests made by the Javascript Library, 
the response is formatted specially.

The response body begins with the value of the callback parameter 
from the request. 
That value is followed by a "(" (opening parenthesis), 
then the JSON-encoded result value, then a ")" (closing parenthesis).
