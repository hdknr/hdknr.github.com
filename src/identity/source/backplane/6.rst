6.  Discovery, Registration and Authorization
=======================================================

For a functional setup, 
the :term:`Bus Owners`, :term:`Backplane Servers` and :term:`Backplane Clients` 
needing Privileged Access have to perform the following preliminary interactions:

-   :term:`Bakplane Clients` must :ref:`discover (Backplane Server Discovery) <backplane.6.1>` 
    :term:`Backplane Servers`' endpoints for registration, authorization, token, message.

-   :term:`Backplane Clients` must :ref:`register (Backplane Client Registration) <backplane.6.2>` 
    with :term:`Backplane Servers`.

-   :term:`Bus Owners` must :ref:`authorize (Authorization) <backplane.6.3>` 
    :term:`Backplane Clients` with Privileged Access.
