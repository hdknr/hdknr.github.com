9.  Channels
========================

A :term:`Channel` is a subset of :term:`Backplane Messages` 
that belong to a :term:`Bus` and are addressed to the :term:`Backplane Clients` 
interacting with the end user through a single session 
and :term:`Web Page`. 

A Channel is similar to a **session identifier** for the user 
but is **shared** by multiple :term:`Backplane Clients`.

Channels are:

-   allocated within :term:`Buses`

-   referenced by unique, unguessable identifiers

-   created implicitly 
    once a :term:`Backplane Message` gets posted to a :term:`channel` that doesn't yet exist

-   **non-persistent** and expire after being inactive (no messages posted) 
    for specific amount of time (e.g. 30 minutes)

-   sensitive; 
    see :ref:`Channel Name Sensitivity (Channel Name Sensitivity) <backplane.15.1>`.

:term:`Channel identifiers` are used by :term:`Backplane Clients` for message retrieval. 
All :term:`Backplane Clients` that know a given Channel identifier 
can receive :term:`Backplane Messages` posted to that :term:`Channel`.

Channel identifiers MUST only contain characters from the :term:`base64url` 
(Josefsson, S., “The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings,” October 2006.) 
[RFC4648.section5] character set 
and be **at least 32 characters** long. 
New :term:`channels` are generated only 
on :term:`anonymous access token requests (Anonymous Access Token Request) <backplane.13.1.1>`.

The channel name **MUST NOT be guessable** given knowledge of the algorithms 
in use or any details of the request being made 
(RFC 4086 (Eastlake, D., Schiller, J., and S. Crocker, “Randomness Requirements for Security,” June 2005.) 
[RFC4086] discusses the requirements and pitfalls of generating unguessable values in great detail).

There can be at most one channel active on a :term:`Web Page` at a given time.
