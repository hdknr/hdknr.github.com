1.  Introduction
=====================

Web pages have evolved from being loaded from a single resource 
to being able to reference third-party, 
external components that get loaded, 
run and rendered by the web browser within the same web page.

These components can be active and continue to run 
after the web page completed loading 
and are generally decoupled 
â€” not under the control of a single entity.

Interactions between the :term:`end user`, the web page, 
and its features provided through such components can greatly benefit 
when all parties involved can exchange information with each other, 
and can do it in a standardized way.

The Backplane framework facilitates such interactions 
by providing an open standard API that is secure 
in the context of the assumed trust relationships 
between the parties involved. 
Messages are delivered **reliably** and **in order**. 
The framework may be used in different scenarios 
which build on top of the transport-level semantics described in this document.
