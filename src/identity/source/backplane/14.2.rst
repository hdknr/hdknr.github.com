14.2.  Subscription Management
------------------------------------------

The library provides a method for Widgets to set up notification callbacks: **Backplane.subscribe**. 
The method returns a subscription id which can be later used for unsubscribing 
using the **Backplane.unsubscribe** method.

After the initialization the library 
starts polling the Backplane Server for new events. 
All incoming events are delivered to the :term:`Widgets` that have registered callbacks with the library.
