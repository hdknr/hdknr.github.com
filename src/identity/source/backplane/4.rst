4.  Trust
========================

The Backplane framework is intended to be used and operate 
under the following trust relationships. 
Any number of security issues can arise if any of these assumptions do not hold.

    The :term:`end user` trusts the :term:`Web Page` owner 
    (and indirectly all Widget owners) that the :term:`Web Page` will not attack or exploit their web browser.

    The :term:`Web Page` owner (and indirectly the end user) trusts all :term:`Widget` owners 
    that the :term:`Widgets` will not abuse the Backplane framework 
    by trying to impersonate other Widgets' behavior 
    in order to obtain and access information that is not directed to them, 
    such as end user account information addressed to other :term:`Widgets`.

    The :term:`Web Page` owner (and indirectly the end user), 
    and :term:`Widget` owners trust the :term:`Backplane Server API` 
    and :term:`Backplane JavaScript API` implementations that they will comply with this specification.

    The :term:`Web Page` owner (and indirectly the end user) trusts all content on the :term:`Web Page` 
    to not attack the widgets or the Backplane framework. 
    This must explicitly include all JavaScript loaded for any purpose, 
    including JavaScript that is not part of any of the :term:`Widgets` on the Web Page.

    :term:`Backplane Clients` trust the :term:`Bus` owner 
    and the authenticity of :term:`Backplane Messages` received through a :term:`Bus`, 
    i.e all :term:`Backplane Clients` that were granted permission to post on the :term:`Bus` by its owner.
