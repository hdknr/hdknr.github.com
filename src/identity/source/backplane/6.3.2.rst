6.3.2.  Backplane Server Initiated Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Backplane Servers MAY provide an administrative interface 
through which Bus Owners can initiate the authorization of registered 
(Backplane Client Registration) Backplane Clients 
using a slightly modified OAuth Authorization Code flow 
described in this section.

Once the Backplane Client has been identified and 
the Bus Owner has selected the Buses for authorization, 
the Backplane Server persists the authorization grant, 
generates an OAuth code for it and 
sends it with an unsolicited OAuth Authorization Response 
to the Backplane Client's redirection URI. 
The successful authorization response SHOULD contain a space sperated list 
with the authorized Bus names in the scope field.

Since an unsolicited OAuth Authorization Response is issued, 
the :term:`Backplane Server`'s token (Access Token Request) endpoint MUST be identified 
in the Redirection URI using a query parameter named :term:`bp_token_endpoint`.

The :term:`Backplane Client` continues by following the OAuth Authorization Code flow 
from this point, and exchanges the authorization code for an access token 
at the Backplane Server's token endpoint, 
as described in sections 4.1.3 and 4.1.4 
(Habber-Lahav, E., Recordon, D., and D. Hardt, “The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol,” May 2011.) 
[OAuth2] and Access Token Request (Access Token Request).
