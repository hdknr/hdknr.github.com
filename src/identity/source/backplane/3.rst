3.  Overview
==========================================

An operational Backplane framework consists of the following components:

-   A :term:`Backplane Server`
-   A :term:`Backplane JavaScript Library`
-   :term:`Widgets` that act as :term:`Backplane Clients`
-   :term:`Widgets`' server-side counterparts that act as :term:`Backplane Clients`.

.. note::
    - Widgets  are Backplane Clients
    - Widget Servers are also Backplane Clients

A :term:`Backplane Server` is an **independent orchestrator** of the message interchange 
between :term:`Backplane Clients` and may serve multiple independent :term:`Buses`.

A Backplane framework instance needs to be configured prior to use: 
all :term:`Backplane Clients` and the :term:`Server <Backplane Server>` have to share the same :term:`Bus`. 
:term:`Backplane Clients` operating at the :ref:`Privileged Access Level (Privileged Access) <backplane.5.2>` 
need a password to authenticate themselves to the Server. 
It is outside the scope of this document how such configuration is performed.
