5.2.3.  Client Authentication and Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As described in Section 3 (Security Features), clients are
identified, authenticated, and authorized for several purposes, such
as to:

-  Collate requests to the same client,

-  Indicate to the user that the client is recognized by the
   authorization server,

-  Authorize access of clients to certain features on the
   authorization server or resource server, and

-  Log a client identifier to log files for analysis or statistics.


Due to the different capabilities and characteristics of the
different client types, there are different ways to support these
objectives, which will be described in this section.  Authorization
server providers should be aware of the security policy and
deployment of a particular client and adapt its treatment
accordingly.  For example, one approach could be to treat all clients
as less trustworthy and unsecure.  On the other extreme, a service
provider could activate every client installation individually by an
administrator and in that way gain confidence in the identity of the
software package and the security of the environment in which the
client is installed.  There are several approaches in between.
