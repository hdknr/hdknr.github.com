5.2.3.  Public client authentication and authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As described in :ref:`Section 3 (Security Features) <oauth_threat.3>`, 
clients are identified, authenticated and authorized for several purposes, such as a

   -  Collate sub-sequent requests to the same client,

   -  Indicate the trustworthiness of a particular client to the end-user,

   -  Authorize access of clients to certain features on the
      authorization or resource server, and

   -  Log a client identity to log files for analysis or statics.

Due to the different capabilities and characteristics of the different client types, 
there are different ways to support achieve objectives, 
which will be described in this section.  

Authorization server providers should be aware of the security policy and
deployment of a particular clients and adapt its treatment accordingly.  

For example, one approach could be to treat all clients
as less trustworthy and unsecure.  
On the other extreme, a service provider could activate every client installation 
by hand of an administrator and that way gain confidence in the identity of 
the software package and the security of the environment the client is installed in.  
And there are several approaches in between.
