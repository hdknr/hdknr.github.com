4.6.2.  Threat: Replay authorized resource server requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An attacker could attempt to replay valid requests 
in order to obtain or to modify/destroy user data.

Countermeasures:

   -  The :term:`resource server` should utilize transport security measure in
      order to prevent such attacks (see :ref:`Section 5.1.1 <oauth_threat.5.1.1>`).  
      This would prevent the attacker from capturing valid requests.

   o  Alternatively, the resource server could employ signed requests
      (see :ref:`Section 5.4.3 <oauth_threat.5.4.3>` ) along with :term:`nounces` and 
      :term:`timestamps` in order to uniquely identify requests.  
      The resource server MUST detect and refuse every replayed request.
