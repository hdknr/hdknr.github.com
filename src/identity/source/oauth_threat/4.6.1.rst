4.6.1.  Threat: Eavesdropping access tokens on transport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An attacker could try to obtain a valid :term:`access token` 
on transport between :term:`client` and :term:`resource server`.  
As access tokens are **shared secrets** between :term:`authorization <Authorization Server>` 
and :term:`resource server`, 
they MUST by treated with the same care as other credentials 
(e.g. end-user passwords).

Countermeasures:

   -  Access tokens sent as :term:`bearer` tokens, SHOULD NOT be sent 
      in the clear over an insecure channel.  
      Instead transport protection means shall be utilized to prevent eavesdropping by an attacker
      (see :ref:`Section 5.1.1 <oauth_threat.5.1.1>`).

   o  A short lifetime reduces impact in case tokens are compromised
      (see :ref:`Section 5.1.5.3 <oauth_threat.5.1.5.3>`).

   o  The access token can be bound to a client's identity and 
      require the client to authenticate with the resource server (see
      :ref:`Section 5.4.2 <oauth_threat.5.4.2>`).  
      Client authentication MUST be performed without
      exposing the required secret to the transport channel.
