5.1.5.8.  Bind token to client id
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An :term:`authorization server` may bind a :term:`token` to a certain :term:`client identity`.  
This identity match must be validated for every request with that token.  
This means can be used, to

   -  detect token leakage and

   -  prevent token abuse.

Note: 
Validating the client identity may require the target server to
authenticate the client's identity.  This authentication can be based
on secrets managed independent of the token (e.g. pre-registered
client id/secret on authorization server) or sent with the token
itself (e.g. as part of the encrypted token content).
