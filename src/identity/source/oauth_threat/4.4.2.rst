4.4.2.  Implicit Grant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the implicit grant type flow, 
the access token is directly returned to the client as a :term:`fragment part` of the :term:`redirection URI`.  
It is assumed that the :term:`token` is not sent to the redirection URI target 
since HTTP user agents do not send fragments server requests.  
Thus an attacker cannot eavesdrop the :term:`access token` on this communication path and 
It cannot leak through HTTP referee headers.
