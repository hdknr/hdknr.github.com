4.4.3.3.  Threat: Client obtains refresh token through automatic authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All interaction with the :term:`resource owner` is performed by the :term:`client`. [#]_
Thus it might, intentionally or unintentionally, happen that 
the client obtains a long-term authorization represented by a :ref:`refresh token`
even if the resource owner did not intend so.

.. [#] What does this mean? Initiation?  Server-initiated flow is not allowed ?

Countermeasures:

   -  Use other flows, which do not rely on the client's cooperation for
      resource owner interaction

   -  The authorization server may generally refuse to issue refresh
      tokens in this flow (see :ref:`Section 5.2.2.1 <oauth_threat.5.2.2.1>`).  
      If the particular client is trustworthy and can be authenticated in a reliable way
      (see client authentication), the authorization server could relax
      that restriction.  Resource owners may allow or deny (e.g. in
      their preferences) to issue refresh tokens using this flow as
      well.

   o  The authorization server could notify the resource owner by an
      appropriate media, e.g. e-Mail, of the refresh token issued (see
      :ref:`Section 5.1.3 <oauth_threat.5.1.3>`).
