5.1.3.  Always keep the resource owner informed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    User is intelligent device.

Transparency to the :term:`resource owner` is a key element of the OAuth protocol.  
The user shall always be in control of the authorization processes and 
get the necessary information to meet informed decisions.  
Moreover, 
user involvement is a further security countermeasure.  
The user can probably recognize certain kinds of attacks better 
than the :term:`authorization server`.  
Information can be presented/exchanged during the authorization process, 
after the authorization process, 
and every time the user wishes to get informed by using techniques such as:

   -  User consent forms

   -  Notification messages (e-Mail, SMS, ...)

   -  Activity/Event logs

   -  User self-care applications or portals
