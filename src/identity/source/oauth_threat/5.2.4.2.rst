5.2.4.2.  Informed decisions based on transparency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`authorization server` SHOULD clearly explain to the end-user 
what happens in the authorization process and 
what the consequences are.

For example, the user shall understand what access he is about to grant 
to which :term:`client` for what :term:`duration`.  

It shall also be obvious to the user, 
whether the server is able to reliably certify certain client properties 
(web site address, security policy).
