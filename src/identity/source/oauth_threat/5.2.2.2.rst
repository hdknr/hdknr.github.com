5.2.2.2.  Binding of refresh token to client_id
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`authorization server` MUST bind every :term:`refresh token` 
to :term:`the id of the client <client_id>` 
such a token was originally issued to and validate this binding for every request to refresh that token.  
This measure is a countermeasure against refresh token theft or leakage.

Note: This binding MUST be protected from unauthorized modifications.
