5.1.5.4.  Limit number of usages/ One time usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`authorization server` may restrict the number of requests or
operations which can be performed with a certain token.  
This mechanism can be used to mitigate the following threats:

   -  replay of tokens

   -  reduce likelihood of successful online guessing

For example, 
if an Authorization Server observes more than one attempt to redeem [#]_  a :term:`authorization code`, 
the Authorization Server MAY want to revoke all :term:`access tokens <access token>` granted 
based on the :term:`authorization code` as well as reject the current request.

As with the authorization code, 
access tokens MAY also have a limited number of operations.  
This forces client applications to either re-authenticate and 
use a :term:`refresh token` to obtain a fresh access token,
or it forces the :term:`client` to re-authorize the access token by involving the user.
