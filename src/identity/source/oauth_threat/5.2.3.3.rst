5.2.3.3.  Client_id only in combination with redirect_uri
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The authorization may issue a :term:`client_id` and 
bind the client_id to a certain pre-configured :term:`redirect_uri`.  

Any :term:`authorization request` with another redirection URI is refused automatically.  
Alternatively, 
the :term:`authorization server` MUST not accept any dynamic redirection URI 
for such a client_id and 
instead always redirect to the well-known pre-configured redirection URI.  

This is a countermeasure for clients without secrets against the following threats:

   -  :term:`Cross-site scripting attacks <XSS>`

   -  Impersonation of :term:`public client` applications
