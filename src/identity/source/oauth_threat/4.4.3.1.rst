4.4.3.1.  Threat: Accidental exposure of passwords at client site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the client does not provide enough protection, an attacker or
disgruntled employee could retrieve the passwords for a user.

Countermeasures:

   -  Use other flows, which do not rely on the client's cooperation for
      secure resource owner credential handling

   -  Use digest authentication instead of plaintext credential
      processing

   -  Obfuscation of passwords in logs
