5.2.3.6.  Client secret revocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An :term:`authorization server` may revoke a client's secret 
in order to prevent abuse of a revealed secret.

Note: 
This measure will immediately invalidate any :term:`authorization code`
or :term:`refresh token` issued to the respective :term:`client`.  
This might be unintentionally for :term:`client identifiers` and :term:`secrets <client secret>`
used across multiple deployments of a particular native or web application.

This a countermeasure against:

   -  Abuse of revealed :term:`client secrets` for :term:`private clients`
