1.  Introduction
============================

This document gives :ref:`security considerations <oauth_threat.5>`
based on a comprehensive threat model for the :doc:`OAuth 2.0 Protocol [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] <oauth>`.  
It contains the following content:
    
    -   Documents any **assumptions** and **scope** considered when creating the threat model.

    -   Describes the **security features** in-built into the :doc:`OAuth protocol <oauth>`
        and how they are intended to thwart [#]_  attacks.

    -   Gives a comprehensive :ref:`threat model <oauth_threat.4>` for OAuth 
        and describes the respective **counter measures** to thwart those threats.

.. [#]  To prevent the occurrence, realization, or attainment of: They thwarted her plans.

Threats include any intentional attacks on :term:`OAuth tokens <token>` and 
:term:`resources <protected resource>` protected by OAuth tokens 
as well as security risks introduced 
if the proper security measures are not put in place.  

Threats are structured along the lines of the protocol structure 
to aid development teams implement each part of the protocol securely.  
For example all threats for **granting access** or all threats for a particular **client profile** 
or all threats for **protecting the resource server**.
