3.2. Access Token
----------------------------

An :term:`access token` is used by a client to access a resource.  
Access tokens typically have short life-spans (minutes or hours) 
that cover typical session lifetimes.  

An access token may be refreshed through the use of a :term:`refresh token`.  
The short lifespan of an access token in combination with the usage of refresh tokens 
enables the possibility of **passive revocation** of access authorization 
on the expiry of the current access token.
