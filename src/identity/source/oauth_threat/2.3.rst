2.3.  Architectural assumptions
----------------------------------------

This section documents the assumptions about the features,
limitations and design options of the different entities of 
a OAuth deployment along with the security-sensitive data-elements 
managed by those entity.  

These assumptions are the foundation of the treat analysis.

The OAuth protocol leaves deployments with a certain degree of freedom 
how to implement and apply the standard.  
The core specification defines the core concepts of an :term:`authorization server` 
and a :term:`resource server`.  

Both servers can be implemented in the same server entity, 
or they may also be different entities.  
The later is typically the case for multi-service providers 
with a single authentication and authorization system, 
and are more typical in middleware architectures.
