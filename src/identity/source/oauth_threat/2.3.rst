This section documents assumptions about the features, limitations,
and design options of the different entities of an OAuth deployment
along with the security-sensitive data elements managed by those
entities.  These assumptions are the foundation of the threat
analysis.

The OAuth protocol leaves deployments with a certain degree of
freedom regarding how to implement and apply the standard.  The core
specification defines the core concepts of an authorization server
and a resource server.  Both servers can be implemented in the same
server entity, or they may also be different entities.  The latter is
typically the case for multi-service providers with a single
authentication and authorization system and is more typical in
middleware architectures.
