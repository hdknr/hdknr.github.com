4.2.3.  Threat: Malicious client obtains existing authorization by fraud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Authorization servers may wish to automatically process authorization requests 
from clients which have been previously authorized by the user.  
When the user is redirected 
to the authorization server's end-user :term:`authorization endpoint` to grant access, 
the :term:`authorization server` detects that the user has already granted access to that particular client.  
Instead of prompting the user for approval, 
the authorization server automatically redirects the user back to the client.

A malicious client may exploit that feature and 
try to obtain such an :term:`authorization code` instead of the legitimate client.

Countermeasures:

   o  Authorization servers should not automatically process repeat authorizations 
      to public clients or 
      unless the client is validated using a pre-registered redirect URI (:ref:`Section 5.2.3.5 <oauth_threat.5.2.3.5>` )

   o  Authorization servers can mitigate the risks associated with automatic processing 
      by limiting the :term:`scope` of Access Tokens 
      obtained through automated approvals - :ref:`Section 5.1.5.1 <oauth_threat.5.1.5.1>`
