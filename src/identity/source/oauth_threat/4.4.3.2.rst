4.4.3.2.  Threat: Client obtains scopes without end-user authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All interaction with the resource owner is performed by the client.
it might, intentionally or unintentionally, happen that the
client obtains a token with scope unknown for or unintended by the
resource owner.  For example, the resource owner might think the
client needs and acquires read-only access to its media storage only
but the client tries to acquire an access token with full access
permissions.

Countermeasures:

   -  Use other flows, which do not rely on the client's cooperation for
      resource owner interaction

   -  The authorization server may generally restrict the :term:`scope` of
      access tokens (:ref:`Section 5.1.5.1 <oauth_threat.5.1.5.1>`) issued by this flow.  If the
      particular client is trustworthy and can be authenticated in a
      reliable way, the authorization server could relax that
      restriction.  Resource owners may prescribe (e.g. in their
      preferences) what the maximum permission for client using this
      flow shall be.

   -  The authorization server could notify the resource owner by an
      appropriate media, e.g. e-Mail, of the grant issued (see
      :ref:`Section 5.1.3 <oauth_threat.5.1.3>`).
