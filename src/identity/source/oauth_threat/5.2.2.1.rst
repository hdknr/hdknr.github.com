5.2.2.1.  Restricted issuance of refresh tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    Authorization server doesn't have to issue a refresh token while issuing an access token.

The :term:`authorization server` may decide based on an appropriate **policy** not to issue :term:`refresh tokens <refresh token>`.  
Since refresh tokens are **long term credentials**, they may be subject theft.  
For example, 
if the authorization server does not trust a client to securely store such tokens, 
it may refuse to issue such a client a refresh token.
