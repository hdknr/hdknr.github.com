5.1.2.  Server authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HTTPS server authentication or similar means can be used to authenticate the identity of a server.  
The goal is to reliably bind the DNS name of the server 
to the public key presented by the server during connection establishment.

The client MUST validate the binding of the server to its domain name.  
If the server fails to prove that binding, 
it is condered a :term:`men-in-the-middle`.  
The security measure depends on the certification authorities the client trusts for that purpose.  
Clients should carefully select those trusted CAs 
and protect the storage for trusted CA certificates from modifications.

This is a countermeasure against the following threats:

    -   :term:`Spoofing`
    -   :term:`Proxying`
    -   :term:`Phishing` by conterfeit servers
