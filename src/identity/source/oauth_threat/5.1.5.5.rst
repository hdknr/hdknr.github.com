:term:`Authorization servers` in multi-service environments 
may consider to issue tokens with different content to different resource servers and
to explicitely indicate in the token the target server 
a token is intended to be sent to (cf. Audience in SAML Assertions).  
This countermeasure can be used in the following situations:

    -   It reduce the impact of a successful replay attempt, 
        since the token is applicable to a single resource server, only.

    -   prevents abuse of a token by a rough resource server or client,
        since the token can only be used on that server.  
        It is rejected by other servers.

    -   It reduce the impact of a leakage of a valid token to a conterfeit resource server.
