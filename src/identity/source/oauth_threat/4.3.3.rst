4.3.3.  Threat: Obtain client credentials over non secure transport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An attacker could attempt to eavesdrop the transmission of :term:`client credentials`
between :term:`client` and :term:`server` during the client authentication process 
or during :term:`OAuth token requests`.  


Impact:

Revelation of a client credential enabling the possibility for
:term:`phishing` or imitation of a client service.

Countermeasures:

   -  Implement transport security through Confidentiality of Requests

   -  Alternative authentication means, 
      which do not require to send
      plaintext credentials over the wire 
      (Examples: :term:`Digest authentication`)
