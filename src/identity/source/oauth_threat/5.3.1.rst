5.3.1.  Don't store credentials in code or resources bundled with software packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because of the numbers of copies of :term:`client` software, 
there is limited benefit to create a single :term:`client id` and :term:`secret <client secret>`
which is shared by all installations of an application.  

Such an application by itself would be considered a "public" client 
as it cannot be presumed to be able to keep client secrets.  

A secret, burned into the source code of the application 
or a associated resource bundle, 
cannot be entirely protected from reverse engineering.  

Secondly, 
such secrets cannot be revoked 
since this would immediately put all installations out of work.  

Moreover, 
since the :term:`authorization server` cannot really trust 
on the client's identity, 
it would be dangerous to indicate to end-users the trustworthiness of the client.
