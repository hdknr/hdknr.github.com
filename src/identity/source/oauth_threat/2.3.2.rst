The following data elements MAY be stored or accessible on the :term:`resource server`:

    -   user data (out of scope)

    -   HTTPS certificate/key

    -   authz server credentials (handle-based design), or

    -   authz server shared secret/public key (assertion-based design)

It is assumed that a :term:`resource server` has no knowledge of :term:`refresh tokens`,
