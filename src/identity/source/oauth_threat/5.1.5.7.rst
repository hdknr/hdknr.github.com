5.1.5.7.  Audience and Token scopes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployments may consider to use only tokens with explicitly defined :term:`scope`, 
where every :term:`scope` is associated with a particular :term:`resource server`.  

This approach can be used to mitigate attacks, 
where a :term:`resource server` or :term:`client` uses a :term:`token` 
for a different then the intended purpose.
