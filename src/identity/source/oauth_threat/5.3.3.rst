5.3.3.  Store secrets in a secure storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The are different way to store secrets of all kinds 
(tokens, client secrets) securely on a device or server.

Most multi-user operation systems segregate the personal storage of
the different system users.  Moreover, most modern smartphone
operating systems even support to store app-specific data in separate
areas of the file systems and protect it from access by other
applications.  Additionally, applications can implements confidential
data itself using a user-supplied secret, such as PIN or password.

Another option is to swap refresh token storage to a trusted backend
server.  This mean in turn requires a resilient authentication
mechanisms between client and backend server.  Note: Applications
must ensure that confidential data are kept confidential even after
reading from secure storage, which typically means to keep this data
in the local memory of the application.
