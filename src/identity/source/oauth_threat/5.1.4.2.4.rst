The :term:`authorization server` may react on failed attempts to authenticate
by username/password by temporarily locking the respective account
and delaying the response for a certain duration.  

This duration may increase with the number of failed attempts.  
The objective is to slow the attackers attempts on a certain username down.

Note: 
this may require a more complex and stateful design of the authorization server.
