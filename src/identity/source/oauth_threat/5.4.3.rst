5.4.3.  Signed requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A :term:`resource server` may decide to accept signed requests only, 
either to replace transport level security measures 
or to complement such measures.  

Every signed request must be uniquely identifiable and
must not be processed twice by the resource server.  
This countermeasure helps to mitigate:

   -  modifications of the message and

   -  replay attempts
