4.3.1.  Threat: Eavesdropping access tokens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Attackers may attempts to eavesdrop :term:`access token` 
on transit from the :term:`authorization server` to the :term:`client`.

Impact: 
The attacker is able to access all resources with the permissions 
covered by the :term:`scope` of the particular access token.

Countermeasures:

   o  Authorization servers MUST ensure that these transmissions are protected 
      using transport-layer mechanisms such as :term:`TLS` or :term:`SSL` (see :ref:`Section 5.1.1 <oauth_threat.5.1.1>`).

   o  If end-to-end confidentiality cannot be guaranteed, 
      reducing :term:`scope`
      (see :ref:`Section 5.1.5.1 <oauth_threat.5.1.5.1>`) 
      and expiry time (:ref:`Section 5.1.5.3 <oauth_threat.5.1.5.3>`) 
      for access tokens can be used to reduce the damage in case of leaks.
