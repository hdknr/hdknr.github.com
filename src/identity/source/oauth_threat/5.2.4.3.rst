5.2.4.3.  Validation of client properties by end-user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the authorization process, 
the user is typically asked to approve a client's request for authorization.  
This is an important security mechanism by itself 
because the end-user can be involved in the validation of client properties, 
such as whether the **client name** known to the :term:`authorization server` fits the name of the web site 
or the application the end-user is using.  
This measure is especially helpful in all situation 
where the authorization server is unable to authenticate the client.  
It is a countermeasure against:

   -  Malicious application

   -  A client application masquerading as another client
