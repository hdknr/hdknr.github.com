4.4.1.11.  Threat: DoS, Exhaustion of resources attacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an :term:`authorization server` includes a nontrivial amount of entropy 
in authorization codes or access tokens 
(limiting the number of possible codes/tokens) and 
automatically grants either without user intervention and 
has no limit on code or access tokens per user, 
an attacker could exhaust the pool by repeatedly directing user(s) browser 
to request code or access tokens.  
This is because more entropy means a larger number of tokens can be issued.

Countermeasures:

   -  The authorization server should consider limiting the number of
      access tokens granted per user.  
      The authorization server should
      include a nontrivial amount of entropy in authorization codes.
