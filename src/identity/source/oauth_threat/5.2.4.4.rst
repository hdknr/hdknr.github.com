5.2.4.4.  Binding of authorization code to client_id
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`authorization server` MUST bind every :term:`authorization code` 
to :term:`the id of the respective client <client_id>` which initiated the end-user authorization process.  

This measure is a countermeasure against:

   -  replay of authorization codes with different client credentials
      since an attacker cannot use another client_id to exchange an
      authorization code into a token

   -  Online guessing of authorization codes

Note: This binding MUST be protected from unauthorized modifications.
