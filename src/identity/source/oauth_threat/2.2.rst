2.2.  Attack Assumptions
--------------------------------

The following assumptions relate to an attacker and resources available to an attacker:

    -   It is assumed the attacker has full access to the network 
        between the :term:`client` and :term:`authorization servers`
        and the :term:`client` and the :term:`resource server`, respectively.  
        The attacker may eaves drop on any communications between those parties.  
        He is not assumed to have access to communication 
        between authorization and resource server.

    -   It is assumed an attacker has unlimited resources to mount an attack.

    -   It is assumed that 
        2 of the 3 parties involved in the OAuth protocol 
        may collude [#]_  to mount an attack against the 3rd party.
        For example, the :term:`client` and :term:`authorization server` may be 
        under control of an attacker 
        and collude to trick a user to gain access to resources.
