5.1.5.6.  Use endpoint address as token audience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may be used to indicate to a :term:`resource server`, 
which endpoint address has been used to obtain the :term:`token`.  

This measure will allow to detect requests from a counterfeit resource server, 
since such token will contain the endpoint address of that server.
