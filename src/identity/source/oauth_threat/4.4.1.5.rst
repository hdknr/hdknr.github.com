4.4.1.5.  Threat: Authorization code phishing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    Is this NOT redirect URI phishing? 
    Becase Authorization Code can be transfered in POST data to clients ?

A hostile party could impersonate the client site and 
get access to the :term:`authorization code`.  
This could be achieved using DNS or ARP **spoofing**.  
This applies to clients, which are web applications, thus
the :term:`redirect URI` is not local to the host 
where the user's browser is running.

Impact: 
This affects web applications and may lead to a disclosure of authorization codes and, 
potentially, the corresponding access and :ref:`refresh tokens <refresh token>`.

Countermeasures:

It is strongly recommended that one of the following countermeasures
is utilized in order to prevent this attack:

   -  The :term:`redirection URI` of the client SHOULD point to a HTTPS protected endpoint 
      and the browser shall be utilized to authenticate this redirection URI 
      using server authentication (see :ref:`Section 5.1.2 <oauth_threat.5.1.2>`).

   -  The :term:`authorization server` SHOULD require the client to be authenticated, 
      i.e. confidential client, so the binding of the :term:`authorization code` 
      to a certain client can be validated in a reliable way (see :ref:`Section 5.2.4.4 <oauth_threat.5.2.4.4.>`).
