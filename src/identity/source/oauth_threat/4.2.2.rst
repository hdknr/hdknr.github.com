4.2.2.  Threat: User unintentionally grants too much access scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When obtaining end user authorization, 
the :term:`end-user` may not understand the :term:`scope` of the access being granted 
and to whom or they may end up providing a :term:`client` with access to resources 
which should not be permitted.

Countermeasures:

   o  Explain the :term:`scope` (resources and the permissions) the user is about to grant 
      in a understandable way - :ref:`Section 5.2.4.2 <oauth_threat.5.2.4.2>`

   o  Narrow :term:`scope` based on :term:`client` - 
      When obtaining end user authorization and 
      where the client requests scope, 
      the :term:`authorization server` may want to consider 
      whether to honour that scope based on who the client is.  
      That decision is between the client and authorization server 
      and is outside the scope of this spec.  
      The authorization server may also want to consider 
      what scope to grant based on the :term:`client type`, 
      e.g. providing lower scope to public clients. - :ref:`Section 5.1.5.1 <oauth_threat.5.1.5.1>`
