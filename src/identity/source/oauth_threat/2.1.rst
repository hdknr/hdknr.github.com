2.1.  Scope
------------------------

The security considerations document only considers :term:`clients`
bound to a particular deployment as supported by :doc:`[I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] <oauth>`.  
Such deployments have the following characteristics:

    -   :term:`Resource server` URLs are static and well-known at development time, 
        :term:`authorization server` URLs can be static or discovered.

    -   :term:`Token` :term:`scope` values 
        (e.g. applicable URLs and methods) are well-known at development time.

    -   Client registration: 
        Since registration of clients is out of scope of the current core spec, 
        this document assumes a broad variety of options 
        from :term:`static registration` 
        during development time to :term:`dynamic registration` at runtime.

The following are considered out of scope :
   
    -   Communication between :term:`authorization server` and :term:`resource server`

    -   Token formats

    -   Except for "Resource Owner Password Credentials" 
        (see :ref:`[I-D.ietf-oauth-v2], section 4.3 <oauth_4_3>`), 
        the mechanism used by :term:`authorization servers` to authenticate the user

    -   Mechanism by which a user obtained an :term:`assertion` and 
        any resulting attacks mounted as a result of the assertion being false.

    -   Clients are not bound to a specific deployment: 
        An example could by a mail client with support for contact list access 
        via the portable contacts API (see :doc:`[portable-contacts] <poco>`).  
        Such clients cannot be registered upfront with a particular deployment and 
        must dynamically discover the URLs relevant for the OAuth protocol.
