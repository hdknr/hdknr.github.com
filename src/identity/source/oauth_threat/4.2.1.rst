4.2.1.  Threat: Password phishing by counterfeit authorization server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OAuth makes no attempt to verify the authenticity of the Authorization Server.  
A hostile party could take advantage of this 
by intercepting the Client's requests and returning misleading or otherwise incorrect responses.  
This could be achieved using DNS or ARP spoofing.  
Wide deployment of OAuth and similar protocols may cause Users 
to become inured [#]_ to the practice of being redirected to websites 
where they are asked to enter their passwords.  

If Users are not careful to verify the authenticity of these websites 
before entering their credentials, 
it will be possible for attackers to exploit this practice to steal Users' passwords.

.. [#] To habituate to something undesirable, especially by prolonged subjection; accustom: "Though the food became no more palatable, he soon became sufficiently inured to it" (John Barth).

Countermeasures:

   o  Authorization servers should consider such attacks 
      when developing services based on OAuth, 
      and should require :term:`transport-layer security <TLS>` for any requests 
      where the authenticity of the authorization server or of request responses is an issue 
      (see :ref:`Section 5.1.2 <oauth_threat.5.1.2>` ).

   o  Authorization servers should attempt to educate Users 
      about the risks phishing attacks pose, 
      and should provide mechanisms that make it easy for users 
      to confirm the authenticity of their sites.
