4.4.3.  Resource Owner Password Credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "Resource Owner Password Credentials" grant type (see [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2], :ref:`Section 4.3 <oauth_4_3>`), 
often used for legacy/migration reasons, allows a client to request an access token using an end-users user-id 
and password along with its own credential.  
This grant type has higher risk because it maintains the uid/password anti-pattern.  

Additionally, because the user does not have control over
the authorization process, clients using this grant type are not
limited by scope, but instead have potentially the same capabilities
as the user themselves.  As there is no authorization step, the
ability to offer token revocation is bypassed.

Impact: 
The resource server can only differentiate scope based on the
access token being associated with a particular client.  The client
could also acquire long-living tokens and pass them up to a attacker
web service for further abuse.  The client, eavesdroppers, or end-
points could eavesdrop user id and password.

Countermeasures:

   -  Except for migration reasons, minimize use of this grant type

   -  The authorization server must validate the client id associated
      with the particular refresh token with every refresh request -
      :ref:`Section 5.2.2.2 <oauth_threat.5.2.2.2>` 

   -  Authorization server MUST ensure that these transmissions are
      protected using transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS or SSL 
      (see :ref:`Section 5.1.1 <oauth_threat.5.1.1>`).
