3.5. Redirection URI
---------------------------

.. note::
    - :term:`redirect_uri'
    - フィッシング避ける為にチェックすること
    - トークンリクエストのときに redirct_uri を提示させてチェックする
    - implicit の場合は事前登録したものとAuthReqのredirect_uriを必ず付け合わせること
    - exact matchがベスト

A redirection URI helps 
to detect malicious client and prevents phishing attacks 
from clients attempting to trick the user 
into believing the phisher is the client.  

The value of the actual redirection URI used 
in the :term:`authorization request` 
has to be presented and is verified 
when an authorization code is exchanged for tokens.

This helps to prevent attacks, 
where the authorization code is revealed 
through redirectors and counterfeit web application clients.

The authorization server requires public clients and confidential clients 
using implicit grant type to pre-register their redirect URIs and 
validate agains the registered redirection URI in the authorization request.
