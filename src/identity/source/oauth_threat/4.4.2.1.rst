4.4.2.1.  Threat: Access token leak in transport/end-points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This :term:`token` might be eavesdropped by an attacker.  
The token is sent from server to client via a :term:`URI fragment` of :term:`the redirection URI`.  
If the communication is not secured or the end-point is not secured, 
the token could be leaked by parsing the returned URI.

Impact: 
the attacker would be able to assume the same rights granted by the token.

Countermeasures:

   -  The :term:`authorization server` must ensure confidentiality of 
      the response from the authorization server to the client 
      (see :ref:`Section 5.1.1 <oauth_threat.5.1.1>`).

.. note::

    "confidentiality of the response" ? Section 5.1.1 is about "confidentiality of the request".
