5.1.1.  Confidentiality of Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is applicable to all requests sent 
from :term:`client` to :term:`authorization server` or :term:`resource server`.  

While OAuth provides a mechanism for verifying the **integrity** of requests, 
it provides no guarantee of request **confidentiality**.  

.. note::

    No request confidentiality by OAuth

Unless further precautions are taken,
eavesdroppers will have full access to request content and 
may be able to mount interception 
or replay attacks through using content of request, e.g. secrets or tokens.

Attacks can be mitigated by using transport-layer mechanisms 
such as :term:`TLS` or :term:`SSL`.  
VPN may considered as well.

This is a countermeasure against the following threats:

   o  Replay of access tokens obtained on tokens endpoint or resource server's endpoint

   o  Replay of refresh tokens obtained on tokens endpoint

   o  Replay of authorization codes obtained on tokens endpoint (redirect?)

   o  Replay of user passwords and client secrets
