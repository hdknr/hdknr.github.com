5.1.4.2.2.  High entropy of secrets
#######################################

When creating token handles or other secrets not intended for usage by human users, 
the :term:`authorization server` MUST include a reasonable level of entropy 
in order to mitigate the risk of guessing attacks.

The token value MUST be constructed from a cryptographically strong random or 
pseudo-random number sequence [RFC1750] generated by the Authorization Server.  

The probability of any two :term:`Authorization Code` values being identical 
MUST be less than or equal to 2^(-128) and SHOULD be less than or equal to 2^(-160).
