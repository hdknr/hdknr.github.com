5.2.4.5.  Binding of authorization code to redirect_uri
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`authorization server` MUST bind every :term:`authorization code` 
to the actual :term:`redirection URI` used as redirect target of the :term:`client` 
in the end-user authorization process.  

This binding MUST be validated when the client attempts 
to exchange the respective authorization code for an :term:`access token`.  

This measure is a countermeasure against authorization code leakage 
through counterfeit web sites 
since an attacker cannot use another redirection URI to exchange an authorization code into a token.
