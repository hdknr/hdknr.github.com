4.3.6.  Threat: DoS on dynamic client secret creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an authorization servers includes a nontrivial amount of entropy 
in client secrets and 
if the authorization server automatically grants them, 
an attacker could exhaust the pool by repeatedly applying for them.

Countermeasures:

   o  The :term:`authorization server` should consider some **verification step** for new clients.  
      The authorization server should include a
      nontrivial amount of **entropy** in client secrets.
