5.2.2.4.  Refresh Token Revocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`authorization server` may allow 
clients or end-users to explicitly request the invalidation of refresh tokens.

This is a countermeasure against:

    -   device theft,

    -   impersonation of :term:`resource owner`, or

    -   suspected compromised client applications.
