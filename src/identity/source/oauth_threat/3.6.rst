3.6. State parameter
------------------------

The :term:`state` parameter is used to link requests and callbacks to prevent :term:`CSRF` attacks 
where an attacker authorizes access to his own resources 
and then tricks a users into following a redirect with the attacker's token.  
It should bind to the authenticated state in a user agent and 
the user agent must be capable of keeping it in a location accessible 
only by the client and user agent, i.e. protected by same-origin policy
