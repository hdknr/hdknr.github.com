4.5.4.  Threat: Obtain refresh token phishing by counterfeit authorization server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An attacker could try to obtain valid :term:`refresh tokens` 
by **proxying requests** to the :term:`authorization server`.  
Given the assumption that the authorization server URL is well-known 
at development time or 
can at least be obtained from a well-known :term:`resource server`, 
the attacker must utilize some kind of spoofing in order to succeed.

Countermeasures:

   -  Server authentication (as described in :ref:`Section 5.1.2 <oauth_threat.5.1.2>` )
