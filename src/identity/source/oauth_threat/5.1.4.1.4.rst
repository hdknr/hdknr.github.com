5.1.4.1.4.  Encryption of credentials
#############################################

For :term:`client` applications, 
insecurely persisted client credentials are easy targets for attackers to obtain.  
Store client credentials using an encrypted persistence mechanism 
such as a :term:`keystore` or database.

Note that compiling client credentials directly into client code
makes client applications vulnerable to scanning 
as well as difficult to administer should client credentials change over time.


.. note::

    DON'T embed credentioas into programme code.
