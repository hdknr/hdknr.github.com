4.1.3. Threat: Obtain Access Tokens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the client type, 
there are different ways :term:`access tokens` may be revealed to an attacker.  
Access tokens could be stolen from the device if the application stores them in a storage, 
which is accessible to other applications.

Impact: 
Where the token is a :term:`bearer token` and no additional mechanism is used to identify the client, 
the attacker can access all resources associated with the token and its scope.

Countermeasures:

    -   Keep access tokens in transient memory and limit grants: :ref:`Section 5.1.6 <oauth_threat.5.1.6>`

    -   Limited scope tokens - :ref:`Section 5.1.5.1 <oauth_threat.5.1.5.1>`

    -   Keep access tokens in private memory or apply same protection means as for refresh tokens - :ref:`Section 5.2.2 <oauth_threat.5.2.2>`

    -   Keep access token lifetime short - :ref:`Section 5.1.5.3 <oauth_threat.5.1.5.3>`
