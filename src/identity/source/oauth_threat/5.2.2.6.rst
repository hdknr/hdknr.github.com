5.2.2.6.  X-FRAME-OPTION header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For newer browsers, 
avoidance of iFrames can be enforced server side by using the :term:`X-FRAME-OPTION` header.  
This header can have two values, deny and same origin, 
which will block any framing or framing by sites with a different origin, respectively.

This is a countermeasure against the following threats:

    -   :term:`Clickjacking` attacks
