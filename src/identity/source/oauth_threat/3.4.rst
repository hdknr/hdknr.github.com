3.4. Authorization Code
--------------------------------

An :term:`Authorization Code` represents 
the intermediary result of a successful :term:`end-user` authorization process 
and is used by the :term:`client` to obtain access and refresh token.  
Authorization codes are sent to the client's redirection URI instead of tokens for two purposes.

    1.  Instead of (longer-lasting) tokens, 
        the short-living authorization code is exposed to potential attackers 
        via URI query parameters (HTTP referrer), browser cacher or log file entries.

    2.  It is much simpler to authenticate clients during the direct request 
        between client and :term:`authorization server` 
        than in the context of the indirect authorization request.  
        The later would require digital signatures.
