5.4.1.  Authorization headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:term:`Authorization headers <Authorization Header>` are recognized 
and specially treated by HTTP proxies and servers.  
Thus the usage of such headers for sending
:term:`access tokens` to :term:`resource servers` reduces the likelihood of leakage
or unintended storage of authenticated requests in general and
especially Authorization headers.
