4.1.4.  Threat: End-user credentials phished using compromised or embedded browser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A malicious application could attempt to phish end-user passwords 
by misusing an embedded browser in the end-user authorization process,
or by presenting its own user-interface instead of allowing trusted system browser 
to render the authorization user interface.  

By doing so, the usual visual trust mechanisms may be bypassed 
(e.g.  TLS confirmation, web site mechanisms).  
By using an embedded or internal client application user interface, 
the client application has access to additional information it should not have access to 
(e.g. uid/ password).

Impact: 
If the client application or the communication is compromised, 
the user would not be aware and all information in the authorization exchange could be captured 
such as username and password.

Countermeasures:

   o    Client developers and end-user can be educated 
        to trust an external System-Browser only.

   o    Client applications could be validated prior publication 
        in a application market.

   o    Client developers should not collect authentication information directly 
        from users and should instead use redirects to and back from a trusted external system-browser.
