5.2.3.1.  Don't issue secrets to public clients or clients with inappropriate security policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    Clients:
   
        - :term:`public client` 
        - :term:`private client` 
  
:term:`Authorization servers` should not issue secrets 
to "public" clients that cannot protect secrets.  
This prevents the server from overestimating the value of 
a successful authentication of the client.

For example, 
it is of limited benefit to create a single client id and secret 
which is shared by all installations of a native
application.  Such a scenario requires that this secret must be
transmitted from the developer via the respective distribution
channel, e.g. an application market, to all installations of the
application on end-user devices.  A secret, burned into the source
code of the application or a associated resource bundle, cannot be
entirely protected from reverse engineering.  Secondly, such secrets
cannot be revoked since this would immediately put all installations
out of work.  Moreover, since the authorization server cannot really
trust on the client's identity, it would be dangerous to indicate to
end-users the trustworthiness of the client.

There are other ways to achieve a reasonable security level, as
described in the following sections.
