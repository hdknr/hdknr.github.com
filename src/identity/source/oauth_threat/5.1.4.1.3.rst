5.1.4.1.3.  No cleartext storage of credentials
######################################################

.. note::

    No Cleartext. But Hashed.

The :term:`authorization server` may consider to not store credential in clear text.  
Typical approaches are to store hashes instead.  
If the credential lacks a reasonable entropy level 
(because it is a user password) an additional salt will harden the storage 
to prevent offline :term:`dictionary attacks`.  

Note: 
Some authentication protocols require the authorization server 
to have access to the secret in the clear.  
Those protocols cannot be implemented if the server only has access to hashes.
