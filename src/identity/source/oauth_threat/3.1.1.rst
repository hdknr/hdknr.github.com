3.1.1. Scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A :term:`Scope` represents the access authorization associated with a particular token 
with respect to resource servers, resources and methods on those resources.  
Scopes are the OAuth way to explicitly manage the power associated with an access token.  
A scope can be controlled by the :term:`authorization server` and/or the :term:`end-user` 
in order to limit access to resources for OAuth clients these parties deem [#]_ less secure or trustworthy.  

Optionally, 
the client can request the scope to apply to the token 
but only for lesser scope than would otherwise be granted, 
e.g. to reduce the potential impact if this token is sent over non secure channels.  
A scope is typically complemented by a restriction on a token's lifetime.
