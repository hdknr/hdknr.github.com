1.3.3.  Protected Resource Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`resource server` MAY present 
to clients whatever HTTP-based APIs or endpoints it wishes.  

To protect any of its resources available 
in this fashion using UMA, 
it MUST require a :term:`requesting party token` 
(RPT) with sufficient authorization data for access.


This specification defines one RPT profile, 
call "bearer" (see :ref:`Section 3.3.2 <uma_core.3.3.2>`), 
which the :term:`authorization server` MUST support.  

It MAY support additional RPT profiles, 
and MUST declare all supported RPT profiles 
in its configuration data (see :ref:`Section 1.4 <uma_core.1.4>`).

An RPT binds a :term:`requesting party`, 
the :term:`client` being used by that party,
the resource server at which :term:`protected resources` 
of interest reside,
and the authorization server that protects those resources.  

It is not specific to a single resource owner, 
though its internal components are likely 
to be bound to individual resource owners,
depending on the RPT profile in use.
