Abstract
=================================

User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  

UMA defines how :ref:`resource owners` can control :term:`protected-resource access` 
by :term:`clients` operated by arbitrary :term:`requesting parties`, 
where the resources reside on any number of :term:`resource servers`, 
and where a centralized :term:`authorization server` governs access 
based on :term:`resource owner` policy.Met at advisory in Feb 2014.
