Abstract
=================================

User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0.  

UMA defines how :term:`resource owners` can control access to their :term:`protected resources` 
made by :term:`clients` operated by arbitrary rquesting parties, 
where the resources reside on any number of resource servers, 
and where a centralized :term:`authorization server` governs access 
based on :term:`resource owner policy`.
