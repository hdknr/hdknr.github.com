3.4.  Requester-AM: Ask for Requester Permission Token and Permission
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A requester making an access attempt accompanied by no RPT 
or by an :term:`invalid RPT` will receive a **401 response** back from the host, 
along with the AM's location from which it can learn the RPT endpoint.  
In this case, 
the requester must obtain a valid RPT from the AM's RPT endpoint provided 
in the response (see Section 3.4.4).

A requester making an access attempt with a valid RPT 
that has insufficient permissions associated with it 
will receive a 403 response back from the host, 
along with a :term:`permission ticket` 
and the AM's location from which it can learn the :term:`permission request endpoint.`  

In this case, 
the requester uses the :term:`permission ticket` 
to ask for the necessary permission to be associated with its RPT.  
This process necessarily involves the requesting party 
(the natural or legal person operating the requester application).

The requester takes action in the following ways.
