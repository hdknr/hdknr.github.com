3.4.  Requester-AM: Ask for Requester Permission Token and Permission
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A :term:`requester` making an access attempt accompanied by no :term:`RPT` 
or by an :term:`invalid RPT` will receive a **401 response** back from the :term:`host`, 
along with the AM's location from which it can learn the :term:`RPT endpoint`.  

In this case, 
the :term:`requester` must obtain a valid RPT from the AM's :term:`RPT endpoint` provided 
in the response (see :ref:`Section 3.4.4 <uma_core.3.4.4>`).

.. note::
    AAT is required to get RPT.

A :term:`requester` making an access attempt with a valid RPT 
that has insufficient permissions associated with it 
will receive a 403 response back from the :term:`host`, 
along with a :term:`permission ticket` 
and the AM's location from which it can learn the :term:`permission request endpoint`.  

In this case, 
the :term:`requester` uses the :term:`permission ticket` 
to ask for the necessary permission to be associated with its RPT.  
This process necessarily involves the :term:`requesting party` 
(the natural or legal person operating the requester application).
