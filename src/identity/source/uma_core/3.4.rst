3.4.  Client Seeks Authorization for Access
----------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::
    - クライアントが認可を求める

In order to access a protected resource successfully, 
a client needs to present a valid :term:`RPT` 
with sufficient authorization data for access.

To get to this stage requires a number of previously successful steps:

   1.  The authorization server issues **client credentials** to the client.

       It is OPTIONAL for the :term:`client credentials` to be provided
       dynamically through :term:`[DynClientReg]`; 
       alternatively, they MAY use a static process.

   2.  The client acquires an :term:`AAT`.  

   3.  The client uses the :term:`authorization API` to acquire an RPT.

       See :ref:`Section 3.4.1 <uma_core.3.4.1>` for more detail.

   4.  The client uses authorization API to ask for authorization,
       providing the :term:`permission ticket` it got from the :term:`resource server`.  

       The authorization server associates :term:`authorization data` 
       with the client's :term:`RPT` based on the :term:`permission ticket`, 
       the :term:`resource owner`'s operative policies, 
       and the results of any claims-gathering flows.

       See :ref:`Section 3.4.2 <uma_core.3.4.2>` for more detail.
