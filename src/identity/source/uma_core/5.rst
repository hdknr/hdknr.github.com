5.  Security Considerations
================================================

This specification relies mainly on :term:`OAuth` security mechanisms for
protecting the :term:`host registration endpoint` at the :term:`AM` 
so that only a properly authorized :term:`host` can access it 
on behalf of the intended user.  
For example, 
the :term:`host` needs to use a valid :term:`host access token` issued 
through :term:`a user authorization process` at the endpoint, 
and the interaction SHOULD take place over TLS.  
It is expected that the :term:`host` will protect its :term:`client secret` 
(if it was issued one) and its :term:`host access token`, 
particularly if used in ":term:`bearer token`" fashion.

In addition, 
this specification dictates a binding between the :term:`host access token` 
and the host-specific :term:`registration area` on the :term:`AM` 
to prevent a :term:`host` from interacting with a :term:`registration area` not its own.

This specification defines a number of JSON-based data formats.  
As a subset of the JavaScript scripting language, 
JSON data SHOULD be consumed through a process that does not dynamically execute it 
as code, to avoid malicious code execution.  
One way to achieve this is to use a JavaScript interpreter 
rather than the built-in JavaScript eval() function.

For information about the technical, operational, and legal elements
of trust establishment between :term:`UMA` entities and parties, 
which affects security considerations, see [:term:`UMA-trustmodel`].
