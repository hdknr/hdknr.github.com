3.5.1.1.  OpenID Connect Claim Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section defines the OpenID Connect claim profile for UMA.

Following is a summary:

   -  Identifying URI: http://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/profiles/uma-claim-openid-1.0

   -  Profile author and contact information: Thomas Hardjono
      (hardjono@mit.edu)

   -  Updates or obsoletes: None; this profile is new.

   -  Syntax and semantics of claim data: As defined below.  The claim
      data format leverages the OpenID Connect protocol and the reserved
      claims defined in that specification.

   -  Claims gathering method: As defined below.

   -  Error states: None additional.

   -  Security and privacy considerations: None additional.

   -  Binding obligations: Binding obligations that apply to the use of
      this claim profile are documented in :term:`[UMA-obligations]`.

If an authorization server supports the OpenID Connect claim profile,
it MUST supply the "openid" value for one of its
"claim_profiles_supported" values in its configuration data.

To conform to this option, the authorization server MUST do the following:

   -  Serve as a conforming OpenID Relying Party according to :term:`[OIDCCore]`

   -  Be able to utilize at least all of the reserved claims defined in
      [OIDCCore] in evaluating policy and adding :term:`authorization data` to RPTs

   -  Use the OpenID Connect "redirect_uri" and "state" request parameters 
      as appropriate

The authorization server can then use any conforming OpenID Connect
mechanisms and typical user interfaces for engaging with the UserInfo
endpoints of OpenID Providers and Claims Providers, potentially
allowing for the delivery of "trusted claims" (such as a verified
email address or a date or birth) on which authorization policy for
access may depend.
