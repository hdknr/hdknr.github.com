3.5.1.1.  OpenID Connect Claim Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an AM supports the OpenID Connect claim profile, it MUST supply
the "openid" value for one of its claim_profiles_supported values in
its AM configuration data (see Section 1.5 for how to formulate this
data).

To conform to this option, the AM MUST do the following:

-   Serve as a conforming OpenID Relying Party and Claims Client
    according to [OCStandard]

-   Be able to utilize at least all of the reserved claims defined in
    [OCMessages] in assessing policy and granting permissions

-   Use the OpenID Connect "redirect_uri" and "state" request
    parameters as appropriate

The AM can then use any conforming OpenID Connect mechanisms and
typical user interfaces for engaging with the UserInfo endpoints of
OpenID Providers and Claims Providers, potentially allowing for the
delivery of "trusted claims" (such as a verified email address or a
date or birth) on which authorization policy may depend.
