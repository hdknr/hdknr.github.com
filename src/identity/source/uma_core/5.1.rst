5.1.  Specifying UMA Profiles
---------------------------------------

This section provides a checklist of issues that MUST be addressed by each profile.

   1.  Specify a URI that uniquely identifies the profile, postal or
       electronic contact information for the author, and provide
       reference to previously defined profiles that the new profile
       updates or obsoletes.

   2.  Specify the set of interactions between parties involved in the
       profile.  Any restrictions on applications used by each party and
       the protocols involved in each interaction must be explicitly
       called out.

   3.  Identify the parties involved in each interaction, including how
       many parties are involved and whether intermediaries may be
       involved.

   4.  Specify the method of authentication of parties involved in each
       interaction, including whether authentication is required and
       acceptable authentication types.

   5.  Identify the level of support for message integrity, including
       the mechanisms used to ensure message integrity.

   6.  Identify the level of support for confidentiality, including
       whether a third party may view the contents of UMA messages,
       whether the profile requires confidentiality, and the mechanisms
       recommended for achieving confidentiality.

   7.  Identify the error states, including the error states at each
       participant, especially those that receive and process UMA
       messages.

   8.  Identify security considerations, including analysis of threats
       and description of countermeasures.

   9.  Identify relevant UMA metadata defined and/or utilized by the
       profile.
