3.3.1.  Token Introspection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within any RPT profile, 
when a :term:`resource server` needs to introspect a token 
in a non-self-contained way to determine its status, 
it MAY require, allow, or prohibit 
use of the OAuth token introspection endpoint 
(defined by :term:`[OAuth-introspection]`) 
that is part of the protection API, and MAY profile its usage.  

The resource server MUST use the POST method 
in interacting with the endpoint, 
not the GET method also defined by :term:`[OAuth-introspection]`.
