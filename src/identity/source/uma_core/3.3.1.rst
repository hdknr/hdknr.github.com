3.3.1.  Token Introspection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within any RPT profile, when a resource server needs to introspect a
token in a non-self-contained way to determine its status, it MUST
use the authorization server's OAuth introspection endpoint, defined
by :term:`[OAuth-introspection]`.  

Any UMA token profile MAY require, allow, or prohibit use of the token introspection endpoint, and MAY profile
its usage.  The authorization server MUST OAuth-protect this endpoint
and require a PAT from the resource server for access to it.  The
resource server MUST use the POST method in interacting with the
endpoint, not the GET method also defined by :term:`[OAuth-introspection]`.
