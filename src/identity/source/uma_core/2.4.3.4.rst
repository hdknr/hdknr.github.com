2.4.3.4.  Delete Resource Set Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deletes a previously registered resource set description using the
DELETE method, thereby removing it from the AM's protection regime.

   DELETE /resource_set/{rsid}
   If-Match: (entity tag of resource)
   ...

Form of a successful HTTP response:

   ...

As defined in :ref:`Section 2.4.3 <uma_core.2.4.3>`, if the referenced resource does not
exist the AM MUST produce an error response with an error property
value of "not_found", and if the entity tag does not match the AM
MUST produce an error response with an error property value of
"precondition_failed".
