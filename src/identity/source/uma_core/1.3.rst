1.3.  APIs and Protection
--------------------------------------------------------

UMA involves three APIs, all of which are protected.

The authorization server has the opportunity to manage the validity
periods of access tokens that it issues, their corresponding refresh
tokens where applicable, the individual data components associated
with RPTs where applicable, and even the client credentials that it
issues.  Different time-to-live strategies may be suitable for
different resources and scopes of access, and the authorization
server has the opportunity to give the resource owner control over
lifetimes of tokens and authorization data issued on their behalf
through policy.  These options are all outside the scope of this
specification.
