1.3. Endpoints, Endpoint Protection, and Tokens
------------------------------------------------------------

Various UMA entities present protected APIs for other entities to use.  

These APIs are as follows:

保護API(PAT)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   -  The authorization server presents a _protection API_ to the
      resource server, which encompasses the resource registration API
      defined by the OAuth introduction specification
      [OAuth-resource-reg], as well as additional functions standardized
      by this specification.  

      This API is OAuth-protected, 
      requiring a resource server to obtain from the authorization server an OAuth
      access token called a _protection API token (PAT)_.

認可API(AAT)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   -  The authorization server presents an _authorization API_ to the
      client, as defined wholly by this specification.  

      This API is OAuth-protected, 
      requiring a client and its requesting party to obtain 
      from the authorization server an OAuth access token,
      referred to in this specification 
      as an _authorization API token (AAT)_ 
      to distinguish it from other tokens with other purposes.

リソースAPI(RPT)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   -  The resource server presents a _protected resource_ to the client,
      which can be considered an application-specific or proprietary API.  

      This API is protected by the UMA profile of OAuth, requiring
      a client to obtain from the authorization server an OAuth access token, 
      referred to in this specification as a _requesting party token (RPT)_ 
      to distinguish it from other tokens with other purposes.

標準OAuth エンドポイント
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The authorization server presents standard OAuth endpoints 
for token issuance and resource owner authorization 
in protecting its own UMA APIs, as follows.  

Resource servers asking to use the protection API would be issued a PAT.  
Clients and requesting parties asking to use the authorization API would be issued an AAT.

.. glossary::

   token endpoint  
         Part of standard OAuth, as profiled by UMA.  

         The endpoint at which the resource server asks for a PAT on the
         resource owner's behalf.  Also the endpoint at which the client
         asks for an AAT on the requesting party's behalf.  (The
         authorization server may also choose to issue a refresh token.)
         This specification makes the OAuth token profile "bearer"
         mandatory for the authorization server to implement.  It can
         declare its ability to handle other token profiles.

   user authorization endpoint  
         Part of standard OAuth, as profiled by UMA; 
         used when the authorization code grant type (REQUIRED for
         the authorization server to implement) is being used.  The
         endpoint to which the resource server redirects an end-user
         resource owner to authorize the former to use this
         authorization server in outsourcing resource protection.  Also
         the endpoint to which the client redirects the end-user
         requesting party to authorize the former to use this
         authorization server in seeking access.

リソースサーバー向けエンドポイント
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The authorization server presents the following endpoints 
to the resource server as part of its protection API; 
these endpoints MUST be OAuth-protected and require a PAT for access, 
for which the "http://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/scopes/prot.json" 
OAuth scope is required:

.. glossary::

   resource set registration endpoint  
         The endpoint at which the
         resource server registers resource sets it wants the
         authorization server to protect, as defined by
         :term:`[OAuth-resource-reg]`.  

         The "http://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/scopes/prot.json" scope
         is a superset of the scope that governs usage of the resource
         set registration endpoint.

   permission registration endpoint  
         The endpoint at which 
         the :term:`resource server` registers permissions that 
         it anticipates a client will shortly be asking for from the authorization server.

   introspection endpoint  
         The endpoint at which the resource server
         forwards an RPT that has accompanied an access request to learn
         what authorization data is associated with it, as defined by
         :term:`[OAuth-introspection]`.  

         This specification defines an RPT profile, "bearer", 
         which is mandatory for the authorization
         server to implement and which, if used, REQUIRES the resource
         server to use this endpoint (see :ref:`Section 3.3 <uma_core.3.3>`).  

         The "http://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/scopes/prot.json" scope
         is a superset of the scope that governs usage of the token
         introspection endpoint.

クライアント向けエンドポイント
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The authorization server presents the following endpoints 
to the client as part of its authorization API; 
these endpoints are OAuth-protected and require an AAT for access, 
for which the "http://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/scopes/authorization" 
OAuth scope is required:

.. glossary::

   RPT endpoint  
         The endpoint at which the client asks the authorization
         server for the issuance of an RPT relating to this requesting
         party, resource server, and authorization server.

   permission request endpoint  
         The endpoint at which the client asks
         for authorization data to be associated with an RPT to enable
         authorized access.

リソースサーバーのクライアント向けエンドポイント
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The resource server presents one or more protected resource endpoints
to the client; 
these endpoints are protected by the UMA profile of OAuth and 
require an RPT with sufficient authorization data to permit access:

.. glossary::

   protected resource endpoint  
         An application-specific endpoint at
         which a client attempts to access resources.  
         This can be a singular API endpoint, one of a set of API endpoints, 
         a URI corresponding to an HTML document, or any other URI.

トークン管理
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The authorization server has the opportunity to manage the validity
periods of the access tokens, the corresponding refresh tokens where applicable, 
and even the client credentials that it issues.

Different lifetime strategies may be suitable for different resources
and scopes of access, and the authorization server has the
opportunity to give the resource owner control through policy.  

These options are all outside the scope of this specification.
