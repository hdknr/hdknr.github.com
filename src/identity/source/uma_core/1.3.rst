1.3.  Endpoints, Endpoint Protection, and Tokens
---------------------------------------------------------------

Various :term:`UMA` entities present APIs for other UMA entities to use.
These APIs are as follows:

-   The :term:`AM` presents a :term:`protection API` to the :term:`host`, 
    as standardized by this specification.  
    This API is :term:`OAuth-protected`, 
    requiring a host :term:`access token` (issued by the :term:`AM`) 
    for successful access (see :ref:`Section 2.3 <uma_core.2.3>` for this issuance process).

-   The :term:`AM` presents an :term:`authorization API` to the requester, 
    as standardized by this specification.  
    This API is :term:`OAuth-protected`, 
    requiring a :term:`requester` :term:`access token` (issued by the :term:`AM`) 
    for successful access (see :ref:`Section 3.2 <uma_core.3.2>` for this issuance process).

-   The :term:`host` presents a :term:`protected resource` to the :term:`requester`, 
    which can be considered -- and may in fact be -- 
    an application-specific or proprietary API.  
    This API is :term:`UMA-protected`, requiring a :term:`requester access token` (issued by the AM) 
    and sufficient permissions (also issued by the AM) for successful access 
    (see :ref:`Section 3.5 <uma_core.3.5>` for this latter issuance process).

.. note::

    - These are the "Protection API" endpoint set.

The AM presents the following endpoints to the :term:`host` as part of its :term:`protection API`:

.. glossary::

   host access token endpoint  
        Part of standard :term:`OAuth`, as profiled by :term:`UMA`.  
        The endpoint at which the :term:`host` asks for a :term:`host access token` 
        on the authorizing user's behalf.  
        (The :term:`AM` may also choose to issue a :term:`refresh token`.)  
        It will use this token to gain access to the other :term:`protection API` endpoints.

   host user authorization endpoint  
        Part of standard :term:`OAuth`, as profiled by :term:`UMA`.  
        The endpoint to which the :term:`host` redirects the :term:`authorizing user` 
        to authorize the :term:`host` to use this :term:`AM` for protecting resources, 
        if the :term:`OAuth` :term:`authorization code grant type` is being used.

   resource set registration endpoint  
        The endpoint at which the :term:`host` registers :term:`resource sets` 
        it wants the :term:`AM` to protect.  
        The operations available at this endpoint constitute a resource set registration API 
        that is a subset of the :term:`protection API` (see :ref:`Section 2.4.3 <uma_core.2.4.3>`).

   permission registration endpoint  
        The endpoint at which the :term:`host` registers :term:`permissions` 
        that it anticipates a requester will shortly be asking for from the AM.

   token status endpoint  
        The endpoint at which the :term:`host` submits :term:`requester access tokens` 
        that have accompanied an access request, 
        to learn what currently valid permissions are associated with them.  
        This specification defines a mandatory-to-implement token type, ":term:`artifact`", 
        which REQUIRES the :term:`host` to use this endpoint (see :ref:`Section 3.3 <uma_core.3.3>`).

The AM presents the following endpoints to the :term:`requester` as part of its :term:`authorization API`:

.. note::
    Here are the "Authorization API Endpoint" set.
    
.. glossary::

   requester access token endpoint  
        Part of standard :term:`OAuth`, as profiled by :term:`UMA`.  
        The endpoint at which the :term:`requester` asks for a :term:`requester access token`.  
        (The AM may also choose to issue a :term:`refresh token`.)  
        It will use this token to gain access to the other :term:`authorization API endpoint`.

   permission endpoint  
        The endpoint at which the :term:`requester` asks for authorization 
        to have a new permission associated with its :term:`requester access token`.

Finally, the :term:`host` presents one or more :term:`protected resource endpoints` to the :term:`requester`:

.. glossary::

   protected resource endpoint  
   protected resource endpoints
        An endpoint at which a :term:`requester` attempts to access resources.  
        This can be a singular API endpoint, one of a set of API endpoints, 
        a URI corresponding to an HTML document, or any other URI.  
        The :term:`requester` needs to present a :term:`requester access token` 
        associated with sufficient permissions in order to gain access.

Similarly to :term:`OAuth` :term:`authorization servers`, 
an :term:`UMA` :term:`AM` has the opportunity 
to manage the validity periods of the :term:`access tokens`, 
the corresponding :term:`refresh tokens`, 
and even the :term:`client credentials` that it issues.  

Different lifetime strategies may be suitable for different resources and scopes of access, 
and the :term:`AM` has the opportunity to give the authorizing user control through policy.
