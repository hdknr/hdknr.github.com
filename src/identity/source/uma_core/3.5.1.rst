3.5.1. Claims-Gathering Flow for Clients Operated by End-Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A client, 
whether web-based or native, is operated by an end-user in
one of two typical situations:

   -  The :term:`requesting party` is a natural person 
      (for example, a friend of the resource owner); 
      the requesting party may even be the resource owner herself.

   -  The requesting party is a legal person such as a corporation, and
      the end-user operating the client is acting as an agent of that
      legal person 
      (for example, a customer support specialist representing a credit card company).

For convenience, 
this specification refers to the end-user as a ":term:`requesting end-user`" 
to cover both cases, 
which differ only at the level of business agreements 
(and potentially law), rather than technology.  

The :term:`authorization server` has a variety of options 
at this point for satisfying the resource owner's policy; 
this specification does not dictate a single answer.  

For example, 
the authorization server could require the requesting end-user to
register for and/or log in to a local authorization server account,
or to fill in a questionnaire, or to complete a purchase.  
It could even require several of these operations, 
where the order is treated as significant.  
A variety of claim profiling can be defined to achieve these effects.

An end-user-driven client MUST redirect the requesting end-user to
the authorization server to complete the process of authorization.
The redirection MUST include a URI query parameter with the name
":term:`ticket`" whose value conveys the :term:`permission ticket` 
for which the need_claims error was received; 
for example, 
"ticket=016f84e8-f9b9-11e0-bd6f-0021cc6004de".  

Each claim profile MUST provide the following capabilities:

.. glossary::

   redirect URI  
      A means by which the client MUST supply the URI to
      which the authorization server MUST redirect 
      the :term:`requesting end-user` 
      at the end of the claims-gathering process.

   callback URI  
      A means by which the client OPTIONALLY supplies a
      callback URI for the authorization server to use.

   state  
      A means by which the client SHOULD supply an opaque value used
      to maintain state between the request and the callback; this
      serves as a protection against XSRF attacks.
