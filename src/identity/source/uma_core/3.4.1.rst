3.4.1.  Requester Looks Up AM Configuration Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The requester needs to learn the AM's various authorization API
endpoints.  From the "am_uri" information provided in the host's
response, the requester MUST retrieve the AM's configuration data
document, as described in Section 2 of hostmeta [RFC6415].  For
example, if the "am_uri" is "example.com", the requester creates the
URL "https://example.com/.well-known/uma-configuration" and performs
a GET request on it.  The AM MUST return content that includes UMA
authorization API endpoints as defined in Section 1.5.
