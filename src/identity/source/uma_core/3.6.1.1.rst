3.6.1.1.  Gathering Claims from Requesting End-Users with OpenID Connect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An :term:`AM` MAY use :term:`OpenID Connect` 
as one means of gathering claims from an end-user requesting party, 
leveraging :term:`OpenID Connect` mechanisms to transmit claims from distributed sources.  
If it supports this option, 
the :term:`AM` MUST supply the ":term:`openid`" value for one of its :ref:`claim_types_supported` values 
in its :term:`AM` configuration data (see :ref:`Section 1.5 <uma_core.1.5>` for how to formulate this data).

To conform to this option, the :ref:`AM` MUST do the following:

   -  Serve as a conforming OpenID Relying Party and Claims Client
      according to [:term:`OCStandard`]

   o  Be able to utilize at least all of the reserved claims defined in
      [:ref:`OCMessages`] in assessing policy and granting permissions

The AM can then use any conforming OpenID Connect mechanisms and
typical user interfaces for engaging with the UserInfo endpoints of
OpenID Providers and Claims Providers, potentially allowing for the
delivery of "trusted claims" (such as a verified email address or a
date or birth) on which authorization policy may depend.
