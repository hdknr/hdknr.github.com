3.2.  Requester-AM: Requester Obtains Access Token
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a requester does not possess a valid access token for accessing
resources of a particular user at a particular host, it requests one
from the AM's requester token endpoint.

The requester learns about this endpoint by retrieving the AM's
hostmeta document based on the "am_uri" information that was provided
by the host in its previous response, as described in Section 2 of
hostmeta [RFC6415].  For example, if the "am_uri" is
"am.example.com", the requester creates the URI
"https://example.com/.well-known/uma-configuration" and performs a
GET request on it.

As discussed in Section 1.4, a requester access token represents, at
any one time, the set of permissions for that requesting party to
access potentially many different resource sets (all controlled by a
single authorizing user), with an applicable set of scopes, at that
same host.

The requester SHOULD use the OAuth client_credentials authorization
grant type (see Section 4.4 of [OAuth2]).  If the requester does not
yet have a client identifier and optional client secret prior to
requesting an access token, it MAY request these using
[OCDynClientReg], if the AM supports it (see Section 1.5 for how the
AM MAY indicate support).

(Note that in UMA, unlike in plain OAuth, obtaining an access token
does not automatically convey permission for access to any protected
resource.  The token must first be associated with at least one
suitable permission for scoped access in order for the requester to
succeed in accessing the resource.)
