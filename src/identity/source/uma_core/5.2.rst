5.2.  Specifying UMA Token Profiles
---------------------------------------

This section provides a checklist of items that MUST in particular be
addressed by attribute profiles.

   1.  Specify a URI that uniquely identifies the profile, postal or
       electronic contact information for the author, and provide
       reference to previously defined profiles that the new profile
       updates or obsoletes.

   2.  Identify the syntax and restrictions on the acceptable values for
       the token profile.

   3.  Identify namespace restrictions that are meaningful in the
       profile deployment scenario.

   4.  Identify rules in the processing of the fields within the token
       profile.

   5.  Identify the scopes that are defined in the token profile (e.g.
       grant types in JWT Bearer Token Profile).

   6.  Identify the error states, including the error states at each
       participant, especially those that receive and process claims or
       assertions expressed within the tokens.
