2.3.  Host Obtains Host Access Token
---------------------------------------------

In this step, the host acquires a host access token from the AM.  The
token represents the approval of the authorizing user for this host
to trust this AM for protecting resources belonging to this user.

The host MUST use OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2] to obtain the host access token.
Here the host acts in the role of an OAuth client; the authorizing
user acts in the role of an OAuth end-user resource owner; and the AM
acts in the role of an OAuth authorization server.  Once the host has
obtained an access token, it presents it to the AM at various
protection API endpoints; in presenting these endpoints the AM acts
in the role of a resource server.

The AM MAY support the use of any grant type, but MUST support the
authorization_code grant type, and SHOULD support the SAML bearer
token grant type [:ref:`OAuth-SAML`]
(**urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer**) if it anticipates
working with hosts that are operating in environments where the use
of SAML is prevalent.  The AM MUST indicate all grant types it
supports in its configuration data, as defined in Section 1.5.

The host has completed this step successfully when it possesses a
host access token it can use at the AM's protection API.
