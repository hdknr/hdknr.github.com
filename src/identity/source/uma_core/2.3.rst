2.3.  Host Obtains Protection API Token
---------------------------------------------

In this step, the host acquires a PAT from the AM.  The token
represents the approval of the authorizing user for this host to
trust this AM for protecting resources belonging to this user.

The host MUST use OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2] to obtain the protection API
token.  Here the host acts in the role of an OAuth client requesting
the "http://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/scopes/prot.json" scope;
the authorizing user acts in the role of an OAuth end-user resource
owner; and the AM acts in the role of an OAuth authorization server.
Once the host has obtained its PAT, it presents it to the AM at
various protection API endpoints; in presenting these endpoints the
AM acts in the role of a resource server.

The AM MAY support the use of any grant type, but MUST support the
authorization_code grant type, and SHOULD support the SAML bearer
token grant type [OAuth-SAML]
(urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer) if it anticipates
working with hosts that are operating in environments where the use
of SAML is prevalent.  The AM MUST indicate all grant types it
supports in its configuration data, as defined in Section 1.5.

The host has completed this step successfully when it possesses a PAT
it can use to get access to the AM's protection API on this user's
behalf.
