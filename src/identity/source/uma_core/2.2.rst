2.2.  Host Registers with AM
------------------------------------------------------

If the host has not already obtained an OAuth client identifier and
optional secret from this AM, in this step it MUST do so in order to
engage in OAuth-based interactions with the AM.  It MAY do this using
[:term:`OCDynClientReg`], if the AM supports it (see :ref:`Section 1.5 <uma_core.1.5>` for how the
AM MAY indicate support).
