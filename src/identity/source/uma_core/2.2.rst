2.2. Resource Server Registers Sets of Resources to Be Protected
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the resource server has received a PAT, 
for any of the resource owner's sets of resources that are to be protected by this
authorization server, it registers these resource sets in a timely fashion.  
To do this, the resource server uses the resource set registration API defined in :term:`[OAuth-resource-reg]`.

Note: The resource server is free to offer the option to protect any
subset of the resource owner's resources using different
authorization servers or other means entirely, or to protect some
resources and not others.  Additionally, the choice of protection
regimes can be made explicitly by the resource owner or implicitly by
the resource server.  Any such partitioning by the resource server or
owner is outside the scope of this specification.

On successfully registering a resource set, the RS MUST use access
control mechanisms to limit access to any resources corresponding to
this resource set, relying on the AS to supply currently valid
permissions for authorized access.  The RS MUST outsource protection
to the AS according to the currently registered state of a resource
set.  This requirement holds true so long as the RS has one or more
registsred resource sets.
