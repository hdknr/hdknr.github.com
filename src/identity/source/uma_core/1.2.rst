1.2.  Basic Terminology
---------------------------------------

UMA introduces the following new terms and enhancements of OAuth term
definitions.


.. glossary::

   resource owner
   resource owners
         The "user" in User-Managed Access; an OAuth resource owner.
         This is typically an end-user (a natural person) but it can
         also be a corporation or other legal person.

   requesting party
   requesting parties
         An end-user, or a corporation or other legal person, that uses
         a client to seek access to a protected resource.  The
         requesting party may or may not be the same party as the
         resource owner.

   client
   clients
         An application making protected resource requests with the
         resource owner's authorization and on the requesting party's
         behalf.

   claim
   claims
         A statement of the value or values of one or more identity
         attributes of a requesting party.  

         A :term:`requesting party` may need to provide claims 
         to an authorization server in order to satisfy policy 
         and gain permission for access to a protected
         resource.

   resource set  
   resource sets
         A set of one or more protected resources.  

         In authorization policy terminology, 
         a resource set is the "object" being protected.

   scope type  
         A bounded extent of access that is possible to perform on
         a resource set.  

         In authorization policy terminology, 
         a scope type is one of the potentially many "verbs" that can logically
         apply to a resource set ("object").  

         UMA associates scope types with labeled :term:`resource sets`.

   authorization data  
         Data associated with a requesting party token
         that enables some combination of the authorization server and
         resource server to determine the correct extent of access to
         allow to a client.  

         Authorization data is a key part of the definition of an RPT profile.

   permission  
         A scope of access over a particular :term:`resource set` 
         at a particular resource server that is being asked for by, 
         or being granted to, a :term:`requesting party`.  

         In authorization policy terminology, 
         a permission is an entitlement that includes a "subject" (requesting party), 
         "verbs" (one or more scopes of access), and an "object" (resource set).  

         A permission is one example of authorization data 
         that an authorization server may grant.

   permission ticket  
         A correlation **handle** that is conveyed from an
         authorization server to a resource server, 
         from a resource server to a client, 
         and ultimately from a client to an authorization server, 
         to enable the authorization server to assess the correct resource owner policies 
         to apply to a request for an authorization grant.
