1.2.  Basic Terminology
---------------------------------------

UMA introduces the following terms, utilizing OAuth and other
identity and access management concepts.


.. glossary::

   authorizing user
         An UMA-defined variant of an OAuth :term:`end-user` :term:`resource owner`; 
         a web user who configures an :term:`authorization manager` 
         with :term:`policies` that control how it assigns access :term:`permissions` 
         to :term:`requesters` for a :term:`protected resource`.

   authorization manager (AM)
   authorization manager
   AM
         An UMA-defined variant of an OAuth :term:`authorization server` that
         carries out an authorizing user's :term:`policies` governing access to
         a :term:`protected resource`.

   protected resource
         An access-restricted resource at a :term:`host`, 
         which is being policy- protected by an :term:`AM`.

   host
         An UMA-defined variant of an OAuth :term:`resource server` that
         enforces access to the :term:`protected resources` it hosts, 
         as governed by an :term:`authorization manager`.

   claim
         A statement of the value or values of one or more identity attributes of 
         a :term:`requesting party`.  
         A :term:`requesting party` may need to provide claims 
         to an :term:`authorization manager` in order to
         satisfy :term:`policy` and gain :term:`permission` 
         for access to a :term:`protected resource`.

   requester
   requesters
         An UMA-defined variant of an OAuth :term:`client` that seeks access to
         a :term:`protected resource`.

   requesting party
         A web user, or a corporation or other legal person, that uses a
         :term:`requester` to seek access to a :term:`protected resource`.  
         If the requesting party is a natural person, 
         it may or may not be the same person as the :term:`authorizing user`.

   resource set  
   resource sets
         A host-managed set of one or more resources to be AM-
         protected.  In authorization policy terminology, a resource set
         is the "object" being protected.

   scope 
         A **bounded extent of access** that is possible to perform 
         on a :term:`resource set`.  
         In authorization policy terminology, 
         a scope is one of the potentially many "**verbs**" that can logically apply to
         a :term:`resource set`.  

         Whereas OAuth scopes apply to resource sets that are **implicit**, 
         UMA associates scopes with explicitly labeled :term:`resource sets` ("objects").

   permission  
   permissions
         A :term:`scope` of access over a particular :term:`resource set` 
         at a particular :term:`host` that is being asked for by, 
         or being granted to, a :term:`requester`.  
         In authorization policy terminology, 
         a permission is the "**verb**" portion of an entire policy that also
         includes a ":term:`subject`" (:term:`requesting party`) and an ":term:`object`"
         (:term:`resource set`).
