1.2.  Terminology
-----------------------

UMA introduces the following new terms and enhancements of OAuth term definitions.

.. glossary::

   resource owner
         An OAuth resource that is the "user" in User-Managed Access.
         This is typically an end-user (a natural person) but it can
         also be a corporation or other legal person.

   requesting party
         An end-user, or a corporation or other legal person, that uses
         a client to seek access to a protected resource.  The
         requesting party may or may not be the same party as the
         resource owner.

   client
         An application making protected resource requests with the
         resource owner's authorization and on the requesting party's
         behalf.

   claim
         A statement of the value or values of one or more identity
         attributes of a requesting party.  A requesting party may need
         to provide claims to an authorization server in order to
         satisfy policy and gain permission for access to a protected
         resource.

   resource set  
         A set of one or more protected resources.  

         In authorization policy terminology, 
         a resource set is the "object" being protected.

   scope
         A bounded extent of access that is possible to perform on a
         resource set.  In authorization policy terminology, a scope is
         one of the potentially many "verbs" that can logically apply to
         a resource set ("object").  UMA associates scopes with labeled
         resource sets.

   authorization data  
         Data associated with a requesting party token
         that enables some combination of the authorization server and
         resource server to determine the correct extent of access to
         allow to a client.  Authorization data is a key part of the
         definition of an RPT profile.

   permission  
         A scope of access over a particular resource set at a
         particular resource server that is being requested by, or
         granted to, a requesting party.  In authorization policy
         terminology, a permission is an entitlement that includes a
         "subject" (requesting party), "verbs" (one or more scopes of
         access), and an "object" (resource set).  A permission is one
         example of authorization data that an authorization server may
         issue.

   permission ticket  
         A correlation handle that is conveyed from an
         authorization server to a resource server, from a resource
         server to a client, and ultimately from a client to an
         authorization server, to enable the authorization server to
         assess the correct resource owner policies to apply to a
         request for an authorization grant.
