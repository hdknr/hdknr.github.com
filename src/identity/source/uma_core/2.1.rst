2.1.  Host Looks Up AM Configuration Data
--------------------------------------------------------

The host needs to learn the AM's protection API endpoints before they
can begin interacting.  To get the host started in this process, the
authorizing user might provide the AM's location to it, for example,
by typing a URL into a web form field or clicking a button.
Alternatively, the host might already be configured to work with a
single AM without requiring any user input.  The exact process is
beyond the scope of this specification, and it is up to the host to
choose a method to learn the AM's general location.

From the data provided, discovered, or configured, the host MUST
retrieve the AM's hostmeta document, as described in Section 2 of
hostmeta [RFC6415].  For example, if the user supplied "example.com"
as the Authorization Manager's domain, the host creates the URL
"https://example.com/.well-known/uma-configuration" and performs a
GET request on it.  The AM MUST return content that includes UMA
protection API endpoints as defined in :ref:`Section 1.5 <uma_core.1.5>`.
