2.4.  Host Registers Sets of Resources to Be Protected
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the host has received a host access token, for any of the user's
sets of resources that are to be protected by this AM, it MUST
register these resource sets at the AM's registration endpoint.

Note that the host is free to offer the option to protect any subset
of the user's resources using different AMs or other means entirely,
or to protect some resources and not others.  Additionally, the
choice of protection regimes can be made explicitly by the user or
implicitly by the host.  Any such partitioning by the host or user is
outside the scope of this specification.

See :ref:`Section 9 <uma_core.9>` for an extended example of registering resource sets.
