1.3.2.  API at the Resource Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The resource server presents one or more protected resource endpoints
to the client; these endpoints are protected by the UMA profile of
OAuth and require a requesting party token (RPT) with sufficient
authorization data for access.  This specification defines one RPT
profile, call "bearer" (see Section 3.3.2), which is REQUIRED for the
authorization server to support.  It MAY support additional RPT
profiles.  It MUST declare all supported RPT profiles in its
configuration data.

An RPT represents a binding of a requesting party, the client being
used by that party, the resource server at which protected resources
of interest reside, and the authorization server that protects those
resources.  It is not specific to a single resource owner, though its
internal components are likely to be bound to individual resource
owners, depending on the RPT profile in use.
