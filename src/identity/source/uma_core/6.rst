6.  Security Considerations
========================================

This specification relies mainly on OAuth security mechanisms for
protecting the host registration endpoint at the AM so that only a
properly authorized host can access it on behalf of the intended
user.  For example, the host needs to use a valid protection API
token (PAT) issued through a user authorization process at the
endpoint, and the interaction SHOULD take place over TLS.  It is
expected that the host will protect its client secret (if it was
issued one) and its PAT, particularly if used in "bearer token"
fashion.

In addition, this specification dictates a binding between the PAT
and the host-specific registration area on the AM to prevent a host
from interacting with a registration area not its own.

This specification defines a number of JSON-based data formats.  As a
subset of the JavaScript scripting language, JSON data SHOULD be
consumed through a process that does not dynamically execute it as
code, to avoid malicious code execution.  One way to achieve this is
to use a JavaScript interpreter rather than the built-in JavaScript
eval() function.
