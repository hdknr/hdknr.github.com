6.  Specifying Additional Profiles
========================================

This specification defines a protocol that has optional features.
For implementation interoperability and to serve particular
deployment scenarios, including sector-specific ones such as
healthcare or e-government, third parties may want to define profiles
of UMA that restrict these options.

Further, this specification creates extensibility points for RPT
profiles and claim profiles, and third parties may likewise want to
define their own.  Different RPT profiles could be used, for example,
to change the dividing line between authorization server and resource
server responsibilities in controlling access.  Different claim
profiles could be used to customize sector-specific or population-
specific (such as individual vs. employee) claim types that drive the
types of policies resource owners could set.

It is not practical for this specification to standardize all desired
profiles.  However, to serve overall interoperability goals, the
following sections provide guidelines for third parties that wish to
specify UMA-related profiles.
