6.  Privacy Considerations
=======================================================

The :term:`AM` comes to be in possession of resource set information 
(such as names and icons) that may reveal information about the user, 
which the :term:`AM`'s trust relationship with the :term:`host` is assumed to accommodate.
However, 
the :term:`requester` is a less-trusted party 
(in fact, entirely untrustworthy until it acquires permissions for a requester access
token in UMA protocol step 2).  
This specification recommends obscuring resource set identifiers 
in order to avoid leaking personally identifiable information 
to requesters through the "scope" mechanism.

For information about the technical, operational, and legal elements
of trust establishment between UMA entities and parties, which
affects privacy considerations, see [:term:`UMA-trustmodel`].
