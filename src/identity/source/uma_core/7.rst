7.  Privacy Considerations
=============================================

The AM comes to be in possession of resource set information (such as
names and icons) that may reveal information about the user, which
the AM's trust relationship with the host is assumed to accommodate.
However, the requester is a less-trusted party (in fact, entirely
untrustworthy until it acquires permissions for an RPT in UMA
protocol phase 2.  This specification recommends obscuring resource
set identifiers in order to avoid leaking personally identifiable
information to requesters through the "scope" mechanism.

For information about the technical, operational, and legal elements
of trust establishment between UMA entities and parties, which
affects privacy considerations, see [UMA-trustmodel].
