7.  Conformance

This section outlines conformance requirements for various entities
implementing UMA endpoints.

This specification has dependencies on other specifications, as
follows:

   -  :term:`OAuth 2.0 <OAuth>`: AMs, hosts, and requesters MUST support [:term:`OAuth2`]
      features named in this specification for conformance.  For
      example, AMs MUST support the authorization_code and
      client_credentials grant types.

   -  :term:`hostmeta`: AMs, hosts, and requesters MUST support the [:term:`RFC6415`]
      features named in this specification.

   -  :term:`OpenID Connect`: AMs MAY support [:term:`OCDynClientReg`], and MAY choose
      to conform to the "openid" claim format option, corresponding to
      the OpenID Connect RP role defined in [OCStandard] and support for
      OpenID Connect reserved claims defined in [:term:`OCMessages`].

The AM's configuration data provides a machine-readable method for an
AM to indicate certain of the conformance options it has chosen.
Several of the data properties allow for extensibility.  Where this
specification does not already require optional features to be
documented, it is RECOMMENDED that AM developers and deployers
document any profiled or extended features explicitly and use
configuration data to indicate their usage.  See Section 1.5 for
information about providing and extending AM configuration data.
