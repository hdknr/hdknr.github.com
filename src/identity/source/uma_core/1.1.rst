1.1.  Notational Conventions
------------------------------------------------

The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Unless otherwise noted, all the protocol properties and values are
case sensitive.

The assignment in this document of URI labels is temporary, awaiting
final standardization in the eventual standards body within which
this specification is taken up as a work item.
