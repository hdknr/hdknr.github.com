2. Protecting a Resource
=================================


Phase 1 of UMA is protecting a resource.  

The resource owner,
resource server, and authorization server perform the following steps
to successfully complete Phase 1 
(assuming that the resource server has discovered the authorization server's configuration data 
and endpoints as needed):

   -  The resource server and authorization server establish mutual
      trust through the issuance of client credentials to the resource
      server.  

      It is OPTIONAL for the client credentials to be provided
      dynamically through :term:`[DynClientReg]`); 
      alternatively, they MAY use a static process.

   -  The resource owner, resource server, and authorization server
      establish three-way trust through the issuance of a PAT.  

      See :ref:`Section 2.1 <uma_core.2.1>` for additional details.

   -  The resource server registers any resource sets with the
      authorization server that are intended to be protected.  

      See :ref:`Section 2.2 <uma_core.2.2>` for additional details.
