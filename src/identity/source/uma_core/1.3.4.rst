1.3.4.  Time-to-Live Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    - アクセストークンのTTL

The :term:`authorization server` has 
the opportunity to manage the validity periods of :term:`access tokens` 
that it issues, 
their corresponding :term:`refresh tokens` where applicable, 
the individual data components associated
with RPTs where applicable, 
and even the client credentials that it issues.  


.. note::
    - リソースオーナーがTTLをコントロールできるようにすべき

Different **time-to-live** strategies may be suitable for
different resources and scopes of access, 
and the authorization server has the opportunity 
to give the resource owner 
control over lifetimes of tokens and :term:`authorization data` 
issued on their behalf through policy.  

These options are all outside the scope of this specification.
