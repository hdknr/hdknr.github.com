3.1.  Requester-Host: Attempt Access at Protected Resource
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This interaction assumes that the host has previously registered with
an AM one or more resource sets that correspond to the resource to
which access is being attempted, such that the host considers this
resource to be UMA-protected by a particular AM.

The requester typically attempts to access the desired resource at
the host directly (for example, when a human operator of the
requester software clicks on a thumbnail representation of the
resource).  The requester is expected to discover, or be provisioned
or configured with, knowledge of the protected resource and its
location out of band.  Further, the requester is expected to acquire
its own knowledge about the application-specific methods made
available by the host for operating on this protected resource (such
as viewing it with a GET method, or transforming it with some complex
API call) and the possible scopes of access.

The host responds in one of the following ways.
