3.1.  Client Attempts to Access Protected Resource
----------------------------------------------------------------

This interaction assumes that the resource server has previously
registered one or more resource sets that correspond to the resource
to which access is being attempted.

The client attempts to access a protected resource (for example, when
an end-user requesting party clicks on a thumbnail representation of
the resource to retrieve a larger version).  
It is expected to cover, or be provisioned or configured with, 
knowledge of the protected resource and its location out of band.  

Further, 
the client is expected to acquire its own knowledge 
about the application-specific methods made available by the resource server 
for operating on this protected resource 
(such as viewing it with a GET method, or transforming it with some complex API call) 
and the possible scopes of access.

The access attempt either is or is not accompanied by an RPT.

.. note::
    - リソースはなんとかしてみつけろ(ディスカバリ?)
    - 取得手順は互いに取り決めろ
    - リソースに対してのRPTが既にあったら指定してもいいし、無しでも良い

        - 無いと 401
