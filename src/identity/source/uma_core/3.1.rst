3.1. Client Attempts to Access Protected Resource
------------------------------------------------------------

This interaction assumes that 
the :term:`resource server` has previously registered with an :term:`authorization server` 
one or more :term:`resource sets` that correspond to the resource 
to which access is being attempted,
such that the resource server considers this resource to be protected
by a particular authorization server.

The client typically attempts to access the desired resource 
at the resource server directly 
(for example, 
when an end-user requesting party clicks on a thumbnail representation of the resource).  

The client is expected to discover, 
or be provisioned or configured with, 
knowledge of the protected resource and its location out of band.

Further, 
the client is expected to acquire its own knowledge about
the application-specific methods made available by the resource
server for operating on this protected resource (such as viewing it
with a GET method, 
or transforming it with some complex API call) and the possible scopes of access.

Example of a request carrying no RPT:

::

   GET /album/photo.jpg HTTP/1.1
   Host: photoz.example.com
   ...

Example of a request carrying an RPT using the UMA "bearer" token profile:


::

   GET /album/photo.jpg HTTP/1.1
   Authorization: Bearer vF9dft4qmT
   Host: photoz.example.com
   ...

The resource server responds in one of the following ways.
