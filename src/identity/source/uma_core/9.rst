9.  Conformance
===================

This section outlines conformance requirements for various entities
implementing UMA endpoints.

This specification has dependencies on other specifications, as
referenced under the normative references listed in this
specification.  

Its dependencies on some specifications, 
such as OpenID Connect ([OIDCCore]), are optional depending 
on whether the feature in question is used in the implementation.

The authorization server's configuration data provides a machine-
readable method for it to indicate certain of the conformance options
it supports.  Several of the configuration data properties allow for
indicating extension features.  Where this specification does not
already require optional features to be documented, it is RECOMMENDED
that authorization server developers and deployers document any
profiled or extended features explicitly and use configuration data
to indicate their usage.  See Section 1.4 for information about
providing and extending the configuration data.
