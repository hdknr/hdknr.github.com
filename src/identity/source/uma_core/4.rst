4.  Error Messages
==============================

Ultimately the resource server is responsible for either granting the
access the client attempted, or returning an error response to the
client with a reason for the failure.  [OAuth2] defines several error
responses for a resource server to return.  UMA makes use of these
error responses, but requires the resource server to "outsource" the
determination of some error conditions to the authorization server.

This specification defines additional UMA-specific error responses
that the authorization server may give to the resource server and
client as they interact with it, and that the resource server may
give to the client.
