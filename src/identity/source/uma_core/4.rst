4.  Error Messages
===========================

Ultimately the host is responsible for either granting the access the
requester attempted, or returning an error response to the requester
with a reason for the failure.  [OAuth2] defines several error
responses for a resource server to return.  UMA makes use of these
error responses, but requires the host to "outsource" the
determination of some error conditions to the AM.  UMA defines its
own additional error responses that the AM may give to the host and
requester as they interact with it, and that the host may give to the
requester.
