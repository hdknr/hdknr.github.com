3.6.  Authorization Flows
------------------------------------------------------------

The :term:`AM` MUST base its decisions to add permissions 
to :term:`requester access tokens` on :term:`user policies`.  
The nature of these policies is outside the scope of :term:`UMA`, 
but generally speaking, 
they can be thought of 
as either independent of requesting-party features (for example, time of day) 
or dependent on requesting-party features 
(for example, whether they are over 18).  
This latter case requires the requesting party to
transmit identity claims to the AM in some fashion.

The process for requesting and providing claims is extensible 
and may have a variety of dependencies on the type of requesting party 
(for example, natural person or legal person) 
and the type of requester application 
(for example, browser, native app, or autonomously running web service).  
UMA currently provides a framework for handling human-driven requester apps 
and an optional solution for gathering standardized claims from that end-user, 
and allows for extensions to support other solutions for this use case and other use cases.  
The AM SHOULD document its claims-handling ability in its XRD configuration data 
through the claim_types_supported property (see :ref:`Section 1.5 <uma_core.1.5>`).  
For the business-level and legal implications of different technical authorization flows, 
see [:term:`UMA-trustmodel`].
