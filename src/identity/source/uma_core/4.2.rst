4.2.  UMA Error Responses
--------------------------------------------------

 When a resource server or client attempts to access one of the
authorization server endpoints :ref:`Section 1.5 <uma_core.1.5>` 
or a client attempts to access a protected resource at the resource server, 
if the request is successfully authenticated by OAuth means, 
but is invalid for another reason, 
the authorization server or resource server responds with an UMA error response 
by adding the following properties to the entity body of the HTTP response:


.. glossary::

   error  
      REQUIRED.  A single error code.  Value for this property is
      defined in the specific authorization server endpoint description.

   error_description  
      OPTIONAL.  Human-readable text providing
      additional information, used to assist in the understanding and
      resolution of the error occurred.

   error_uri  
      OPTIONAL.  A URI identifying a human-readable web page
      with information about the error, used to provide the end-user
      with additional information about the error.

Common error codes:

.. glossary::

   invalid_request  
      The request is missing a required parameter or is
      otherwise malformed.  The authorization server MUST respond with
      the HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code.

For example:

::

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/uma-status+json
    Cache-Control: no-store
    ...
    
    {
      "status": "error",
      "error": "invalid_request",
      "error_description": "There is already a resource with this identifier.",
      "error_uri": "http://am.example.com/errors/resource_exists"
    }
