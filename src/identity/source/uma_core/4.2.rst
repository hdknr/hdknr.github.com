4.2.  UMA Error Responses
------------------------------------------------------

When a resource server or client attempts to access one of the
authorization server endpoints or a client attempts to access a
protected resource at the resource server, if the request is
successfully authenticated by OAuth means, but is invalid for another
reason, the authorization server or resource server responds with an
UMA error response by adding the following properties to the entity
body of the HTTP response:


.. glossary::

    error  REQUIRED.  A single error code.  Values for this property are
       defined throughout this specification.
    
    error_description  OPTIONAL.  Human-readable text providing
       additional information.
    
    error_uri  OPTIONAL.  A URI identifying a human-readable web page
       with information about the error.
    
    The following is a common error code that applies to several UMA-
    specified request messages:
    
    invalid_request  The request is missing a required parameter,
       includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more
       than once, or is otherwise malformed.  The authorization server
       MUST respond with the HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code.

For example:

::

 HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
 Content-Type: application/json
 Cache-Control: no-store
 ...
 
 {
   "error": "invalid_request",
   "error_description": "There is already a resource with this identifier.",
   "error_uri": "http://as.example.com/errors/resource_exists"
 }
