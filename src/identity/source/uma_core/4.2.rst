4.2.  UMA Error Responses
--------------------------------------------------

When a client (host or requester) attempts to access one of the AM
endpoints Section 1.5 or a client (requester) attempts to access a
protected resource at the host, if the client request is successfully
authenticated by OAuth means, but is invalid for another reason, the
AM or host responds with an UMA error response by adding the
following properties to the entity body of the HTTP response using
the "application/json" media type:

.. glossary::

   error  
      REQUIRED.  A single error code.  Value for this property is
      defined in the specific AM endpoint description.

   error_description  
      OPTIONAL.  A human-readable text providing
      additional information, used to assist in the understanding and
      resolution of the error occurred.

   error_uri  
      OPTIONAL.  A URI identifying a human-readable web page
      with information about the error, used to provide the end-user
      with additional information about the error.

Common error codes:

.. glossary::

   invalid_request  
      The request is missing a required parameter or is
      otherwise malformed.  The AM MUST respond with the HTTP 400 (Bad
      Request) status code.

For example:

::

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/uma-status+json
    Cache-Control: no-store
    ...
    
    {
      "status": "error",
      "error": "invalid_request",
      "error_description": "There is already a resource with this identifier.",
      "error_uri": "http://am.example.com/errors/resource_exists"
    }
