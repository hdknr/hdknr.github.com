3.3.  Resource Server Determines RPT's Status
------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::
    - リソースサーバーがリクエストパーティトークンの状態を確認
    - 有効か？
    - 有効であれば認可データはあるか？

The resource server MUST determines a received RPT's status, 
including both its **validity** and, if valid, 
its associated :term:`authorization data`,
before giving or refusing access to the client.  

An RPT is associated with a set of authorization data 
that governs whether the client is authorized for access.  

.. note::
    - トークン自体に内容が含まれている
    - あるいはトークンの状態を発行者に聞く

The token's nature and format are dictated by its profile; 
the profile might allow it to be self-contained, 
such that the resource server is able to determine its status locally, or
might require or allow the :term:`resource server` 
to make a run-time introspection request 
of the authorization server that issued the token.

This specification makes one type of RPT REQUIRED 
for the authorization server to support: 
the **UMA bearer token profile**, 
as defined in :term:`Section 3.3.2 <uma_core.3.3.2>`.  

Implementers MAY define and use other RPT profiles.
