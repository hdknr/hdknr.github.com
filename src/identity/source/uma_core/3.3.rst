3.3.  Resource Server Determines RPT's Status
------------------------------------------------------------

The resource server determines a received RPT's status, including
both its validity and, if valid, its associated authorization data,
before giving or refusing access to the client.  An RPT is associated
with a set of authorization data that governs whether the client is
authorized for access.  The token's nature and format are dictated by
its profile; the profile might allow it to be self-contained, such
that the resource server is able to determine its status locally, or
might require or allow the resource server to make a run-time
introspection request of the authorization server that issued the
token.

This specification makes one type of RPT mandatory to implement: the
**UMA bearer token profile**, as defined in :term:`Section 3.3.2 <uma_core.3.3.2>`.  

Implementers MAY define and use other RPT profiles.
