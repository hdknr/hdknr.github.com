3.3. Resource Server Determines the RPT Status
------------------------------------------------------

On receiving an RPT, 
the resource server MUST ascertain its status before granting or denying access to the client.  
An RPT is associated with a set of authorization data that governs 
whether the client is authorized for access.  

The token's nature and format are dictated by its profile; 
the profile might allow it to be self-contained, 
such that the resource server is able to ascertain its status locally, 
or might require or allow the resource server to make a run-time introspection request of the authorization server that
issued the token using [OAuth-introspection].

.. note::
   
    - アサーションにする
    - イントロスペクトする

This specification makes one type of RPT mandatory to implement: 
the UMA bearer token profile, as defined in :ref:`Section 3.3.1 <uma_core.3.3.1>`.  
Alternate RPT profiles MAY define their own unique token formats and MAY require,
allow, or prohibit use of the token introspection endpoint.
