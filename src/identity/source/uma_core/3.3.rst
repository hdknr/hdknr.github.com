3.3.  Host Determines the Requester Permission Token Status
---------------------------------------------------------------------

On receiving an RPT, the host MUST ascertain its status before
granting or denying access to the requester.  An RPT that a requester
provides to a host in order to get access is associated with a set of
permissions that govern whether the requester is authorized for
access.  The token's nature and format are dictated by its defined
profile; the profile might allow it to be self-contained, such that
the host is able to ascertain its status locally, or might require or
allow the host to make a run-time status request of the AM that
issued the token.

This specification makes one type of RPT mandatory to implement: the
UMA bearer token profile, as defined in Section 3.3.1.  Alternate RPT
profiles MAY define their own unique token formats and MAY require,
allow, or prohibit use of the RPT status endpoint.
