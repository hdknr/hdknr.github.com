2.4.1.  Scope Descriptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A scope is a bounded extent of access that is possible to perform on
a resource set.  A scope description is a JSON document with the
following properties and a Content-Type of **application/uma-scope+json**:

.. glossary::

   name  
      REQUIRED.  A human-readable string describing some scope
      (extent) of access.  This name is intended for ultimate use in the
      AM's user interface to assist the user in setting policies for
      protected resource sets that have this available scope.

   icon_uri  
      OPTIONAL.  A URI for a graphic icon representing the scope.
      The referenced icon is intended for ultimate use in the AM's user
      interface to assist the user in setting policies for protected
      resource sets that have this available scope.

For example, this description characterizes a scope that involves
reading or viewing resources (vs. creating them or editing them in
some fashion):

.. code-block:: javscript

   {
     "name": "View",
     "icon_uri": "http://www.example.com/icons/reading-glasses"
   }

Scope descriptions MAY contain extension properties that are not
defined in this specification.  The names of extension properties
MUST consist of a fully qualified URL, or begin with "x-" or "X-".

A host MUST list a resource set's available scopes using URI
references (as defined in :ref:`Section 2.4.2 <uma_core.2.4.2>`).  
The scopes available for
use at any one host MUST have unique URI references so that the
host's scope descriptions are uniquely distinguishable.  A scope URI
reference MAY include a fragment identifier.  Scope descriptions MAY
reside anywhere.  The host is not required to self-host scope
descriptions and may wish to point to standardized scope descriptions
residing elsewhere.  Scope description documents MUST be accessible
to AMs through GET calls made to these URI references

See :ref:`Section 1.4 <uma_core.1.4>` for further discussion of scope-related concepts, and
:ref:`Section 9 <uma_core.9>` for a long-form example of scopes used in resource set
registration.
