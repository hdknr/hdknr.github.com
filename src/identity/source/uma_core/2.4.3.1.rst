2.4.3.1.  Create Resource Set Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adds a new resource set description using the PUT method, thereby
putting it under the AM's protection.  If the request is successful,
the AM MUST respond with a status message that includes an ETag
header and _id and _rev properties for managing resource set
description versioning.

The host is free to use its own methods of identifying and describing
resource sets.  The AM MUST treat them as opaque for the purpose of
authorizing access, other than associating them with the authorizing
user represented by the host access token used to access the API.  On
successfully registering a resource set, the host MUST use UMA
mechanisms to limit access to any resources corresponding to this
resource set, relying on the AM to supply currently valid permissions
for authorized access.

Form of a "create resource set description" HTTP request:

::

   PUT /resource_set/{rsid} HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/uma-resource-set+json
   ...

   (body contains JSON resource set description to be created)


Form of a successful HTTP response:

::

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Content-Type: application/uma-status+json
   ETag: (matches "_rev" property in returned object)
   ...

   {
     "status": "created",
     "_id": (id of created resource set),
     "_rev": (ETag of created resource set)
   }

On successful registration, the AM MAY return a redirect policy URI
to the host in a property with the name "policy_uri".  This URI
allows the host to redirect the user to a specific user interface
within the AM where the user can immediately set or modify access
policies for the resource set that was just registered.

Form of a successful HTTP response:

::

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Content-Type: application/uma-status+json
   ETag: (matches "_rev" property in returned object)
   ...

   {
     "status": "created",
     "_id": (id of created resource set),
     "_rev": (ETag of created resource set)
     "policy_uri":"http://am.example.com/host/222/resource/333/policy"
   }
