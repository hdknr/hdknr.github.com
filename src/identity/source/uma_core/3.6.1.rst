3.6.1.  Authorization Flow for Requester Apps Operated by End-Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A requester app, whether browser-based or native, is operated by a
natural person (human end-user) in one of two typical situations:

   -  The requesting party is a natural person (for example, a friend of
      the authorizing user); the requesting party may even be the
      authorizing user herself.

   -  The requesting party is a legal person such as a corporation, and
      the human being operating the requester app is acting as an agent
      of that legal person (for example, a customer support specialist
      representing a credit card company).

The AM has a variety of options at this point for satisfying the
authorizing user's policy; this specification does not dictate a
single answer.  For example, the AM could require the end-user
operating the requester app to register for and/or log in to a local
AM account, or to fill in a questionnaire, or to complete a purchase.
It could even require several of these operations, where the order is
significant.

An end-user-driven requester app MUST redirect the end-user to the AM
to complete the process of authorization.  If the AM succeeds in
adding the requested permission, it MUST redirect the end-user
requesting party back to the requester app when reporting success.
