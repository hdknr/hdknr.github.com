3.5. Claims-Gathering Flows
---------------------------------

.. note::
    - クレームを要求したり、渡したりする必要がある場合が考えられる
    - Requesting Party 固有のクレーム(年齢制限とか)と、それに依存しないクレームがある
    - Requesting Partyは個人、とそれ以外(ブラウザ、App、Bot...)

The authorization server has a variety of options 
for coming into possession of claims 
in order to satisfy the resource owner's policy;
this specification does not dictate a single answer.  

For example,
the :term:`authorization server` could interact 
with the :term:`requesting party` to gather claims, 
or could accept claims delivered by a :term:`client`, 
or could perform a lookup in some external system.  

The process for requesting and providing claims 
is extensible and can have a variety of dependencies 
on the type of requesting party 
(for example, natural person or legal person) 
and the type of client 
(for example, browser, native app, 
or autonomously running web service).


This specification provides a required framework 
for extensibility through profiling.  

The authorization server MAY support any number of claim profiles, 
and SHOULD document the claim profiles it supports in its configuration data.  

For the business-level and legal implications of different claim profiles, 
see [UMA-obligations].  Optional claim profiles are defined in [UMAclaims].

A client is operated by an end-user in one of two typical situations:

-  The requesting party is a natural person 
   (for example, a friend or family member of the resource owner); 
   the requesting party may even be the resource owner herself.

-  The requesting party is a legal person such as a corporation, 
   and the end-user operating the client is acting as an agent of that
   legal person 
   (for example, a customer support specialist 
   representing a credit card company).

Where a claim profile dictates end-user interaction, 
a further variety of options is possible.  

The end-user could be required to register for and/or log in 
to an account or personal profile, 
or fill in a questionnaire, 
or complete a purchase.  

Several of these operations could even be required, 
where the order is treated as significant 
for evaluating resource owner policies.
