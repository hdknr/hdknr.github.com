3.5. Claims-Gathering Flows
---------------------------------

.. note::
    - クレームを要求したり、渡したりする必要がある場合が考えられる
    - Requesting Party 固有のクレームと、それに依存しないクレームがある
    - Requesting Partyは個人、とそれ以外(ブラウザ、App、Bot...)

The :term:`authorization server` MUST base the addition of :term:`authorization data`
to RPTs on user policies.  

The nature of these policies is outside the scope of UMA, 
but generally speaking, 
they can be thought of as either independent of requesting-party features 
(for example, time of day) or dependent on requesting-party features 
(for example, whether they are over 18).  
This latter case requires the :term:`requesting party` to transmit identity claims 
to the AM in some fashion.

The process for requesting and providing claims is extensible and 
may have a variety of dependencies on the type of requesting party 
(for example, natural person or legal person) and the type of client 
(for example, browser, native app, or autonomously running web service).

UMA provides a framework for handling end-user-driven clients and 
an optional solution for gathering standardized claims from such an end-user, 
and allows for extensions to support other solutions for this use case and other use cases.  

The authorization server SHOULD document its claims-handling ability 
in its configuration data through the claim_profiles_supported property 
(see :ref:`Section 1.5 <uma_core.1.5>`).  

For the business-level and legal implications of different technical
authorization flows, see :term:`[UMA-obligations]`.
