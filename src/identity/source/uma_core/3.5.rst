3.5.  Claims-Gathering Flows
---------------------------------

The AM MUST base its decisions to add permissions to RPTs on user
policies.  The nature of these policies is outside the scope of UMA,
but generally speaking, they can be thought of as either independent
of requesting-party features (for example, time of day) or dependent
on requesting-party features (for example, whether they are over 18).
This latter case requires the requesting party to transmit identity
claims to the AM in some fashion.

The process for requesting and providing claims is extensible and may
have a variety of dependencies on the type of requesting party (for
example, natural person or legal person) and the type of requester
application (for example, browser, native app, or autonomously
running web service).  UMA currently provides a framework for
handling human-driven requester apps and an optional solution for
gathering standardized claims from that end-user, and allows for
extensions to support other solutions for this use case and other use
cases.  The AM SHOULD document its claims-handling ability in its
configuration data through the claim_profiles_supported property (see
Section 1.5).  For the business-level and legal implications of
different technical authorization flows, see [UMA-trustmodel].
