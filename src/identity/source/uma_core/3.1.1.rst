3.1.1. Client Presents No RPT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the client does not present any access token with the request, 
the resource server MUST return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code,
along with providing the authorization server's URI in an "as_uri"
   property to facilitate authorization server configuration data
   discovery, including discovery of the endpoint where the client can
   request an RPT (Section 3.4.2).

   For example:

   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
      WWW-Authenticate: UMA realm="example",
       host_id="photoz.example.com",
       as_uri="http://am.example.com"
      ...
