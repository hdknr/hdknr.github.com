3.1.1.  Requester Presents No Requester Permission Tokne
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the requester does not present any access token with the request,
the host MUST return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code, along
with providing the AM's URI in an "am_uri" property to facilitate AM
metadata discovery, including discovery of the endpoint where the
requester can request an RPT (Section 3.4.4), by the requester.

For example:

::

   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
      WWW-Authenticate: UMA realm="example",
      host_id="photoz.example.com",
      am_uri="http://am.example.com"
      ...
