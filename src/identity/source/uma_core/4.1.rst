4.1.  OAuth Error Responses
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When a client (host or requester) attempts to access one of the AM
endpoints Section 1.5 or a client (requester) attempts to access a
protected resource at the host, it has to make an authenticated
request by including an OAuth access token in the HTTP request as
described in [OAuth2] Section 7.

If the client's request failed authentication, the AM or the host
responds with an OAuth error message as described throughout
Section 2 and Section 3.
