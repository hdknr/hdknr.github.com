4.1.  OAuth Error Responses
--------------------------------

When a resource server or client 
attempts to access one of the authorization server endpoints 
or a client attempts to access a protected resource 
at the resource server, 
it has to make an authenticated request 
by including an OAuth access token in the HTTP request 
as described in [OAuth2] :ref:`Section 7.2 <oauth.7.2>`.

If the request failed authentication, 
the authorization server or the resource server responds 
with an OAuth error message as described 
throughout :ref:`Section 2 <uma_core.2>` 
and :ref:`Section 3 <uma_core.3>`.
