4.1.  OAuth Error Responses
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When a :term:`resource server` or :term:`client` attempts to access 
one of the :term:`authorization server` endpoints :ref:`Section 1.5 <uma_core.1.5>` 
or a client attempts to access a protected resource at the :term:`resource server`, 
it has to make an authenticated request 
by including an OAuth access token in the HTTP request 
as described in :term:`[OAuth2]` :ref:`Section 7 <oauth.7>`.

If the request failed authentication, the authorization server 
or the resource server responds with an OAuth error message 
as described throughout :ref:`Section 2 <uma_core.2>` and :ref:`Section 3 <uma_core.3>`.
