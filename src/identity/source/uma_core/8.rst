8.  Privacy Considerations
========================================================

The authorization server comes to be in possession of resource set
information (such as names and icons) that may reveal information
about the resource owner, which the authorization server's trust
relationship with the resource server is assumed to accommodate.
However, the client is a less-trusted party -- in fact, entirely
untrustworthy until authorization data is associated with its RPT.
This specification depends on [OAuth-resource-reg], which recommends
obscuring resource set identifiers in order to avoid leaking
personally identifiable information to clients through the scope
mechanism.

For information about the technical, operational, and legal elements
of trust establishment between UMA entities and parties, which
affects privacy considerations, see [UMA-obligations].

Additional considerations 
related to Privacy by Design concepts are discussed in :term:`[UMA-PbD]`.
