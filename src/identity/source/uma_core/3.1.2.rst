3.1.2.  Requester Presents a Requester Permission Token That Has Insufficient Permission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


If the requester presents an RPT with its request, the host SHOULD
determine the RPT's status (see Section 3.3).  If the RPT is invalid,
the host redirects the requester to the RPT endpoint at the AM in
order to obtain a correct RPT (see Section 3.4.4).

If the RPT is valid but has insufficient permission for the type of
access sought, the Host SHOULD register a permission with the AM that
would suffice for that scope of access (see Section 3.2), and then
respond to the requester with the HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code,
along with providing the AM's URI in the header of the message and
the permission ticket it just received from the AM in the body in
JSON form.

Example of the host's response:

::

   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   WWW-Authenticate: UMA realm="example",
     host_id="photoz.example.com",
     am_uri="http://am.example.com"

   {
    "ticket": "016f84e8-f9b9-11e0-bd6f-0021cc6004de"
   }
