3.1.3.2.  Requester's Token Has Sufficient Permission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the token status is associated with at least one currently valid
permission that applies to the scope of access attempted by the
requester, the host MUST give access to the desired resource.

For example:

::

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: image/jpeg
   ...

   /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAgAAZABkAAD/7AARRHVja
   3kAAQAEAAAAPAAA/+4ADkFkb2JlAGTAAAAAAf
   /bAIQABgQEBAUEBgUFBgkGBQYJCwgGBggLDAo
   KCwoKDBAMDAwMDAwQDA4PEA8ODBMTFBQTExwb

This response constitutes the conclusion of Phase 3 of UMA.

The host MUST NOT give access where the token's status is not
associated with at least one currently active permission hat suffices
for that scope of access.
