2.4.3.2.  Read Resource Set Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reads a previously registered resource set description using the GET
method.  If the request is successful, the AM MUST respond with a
status message that includes an ETag header and _id and _rev
properties for managing resource set description versioning.

Form of a "read resource set description" HTTP request:

::

   GET /resource_set/{rsid} HTTP/1.1
   ...

Form of a successful HTTP response:

::

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/uma-resource-set+json
   ...

   (body contains JSON resource set description, including _id and _rev)

If the referenced resource does not exist, the AM MUST produce an
error response with an error property value of "not_found", as
defined in :ref:`Section 2.4.3 <uma_core.2.4.3>`.

On successful read, the AM MAY return a redirect policy URI to the
host in a property with the name "policy_uri".  This URI allows the
host to redirect the user to a specific user interface within the AM
where the user can immediately set or modify access policies for the
resource set that was read.
