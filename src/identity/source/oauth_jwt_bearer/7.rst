7.  Privacy Considerations
================================

.. note::

    - TLSつかって渡すこと
    - 必要であれば暗号化(JWE)すること
    - 

A JWT may contain privacy-sensitive information and, 
to prevent disclosure of such information to unintended parties, 
should only be transmitted over encrypted channels, such as TLS.  

In cases where it is desirable to prevent disclosure of certain information the client,
the JWT should be be encrypted to the authorization server.


Deployments should determine the minimum amount of information necessary 
to complete the exchange and include only such claims in the JWT.  

In some cases, 
the "sub" (subject) claim can be a value representing an anonymous or pseudonymous user, 
as described in Section 6.3.1 of the Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client
Authentication and Authorization Grants [I-D.ietf-oauth-assertions].
