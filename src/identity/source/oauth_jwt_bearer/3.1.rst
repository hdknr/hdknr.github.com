3.1.  Authorization Grant Processing
------------------------------------------------

If present, 
the :term:`authorization server` MUST also validate the :term:`client credentials`.

Authorization servers SHOULD issue :term:`access tokens` with a limited lifetime 
and require clients to refresh them 
by requesting a new :term:`access token` using the same :term:`JWT`, 
if it is still valid, or with a new JWT.  
The :term:`authorization server` SHOULD NOT issue a :term:`refresh token`.

If the JWT is not valid, 
or the current time is not within the token's valid time window for use, 
the authorization server MUST construct an error response 
as defined in The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].  

The value of the error parameter MUST be the "invalid_grant" error code.  
The authorization server MAY include additional information 
regarding the reasons the JWT was considered invalid 
using the error_description or error_uri parameters.

For example:

::

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
    "error":"invalid_grant",
    "error_description":"Audience validation failed"
   }
