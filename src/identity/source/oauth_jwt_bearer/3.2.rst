3.2.  Client Authentication Processing
---------------------------------------------

If the client JWT is not valid, 
or its subject confirmation requirements cannot be met, 
the authorization server MUST construct an error response 
as defined in The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].  

The value of the error parameter MUST be the ":term:`invalid_client`" error code.  
The authorization server MAY include additional information 
regarding the reasons the JWT was considered invalid 
using the error_description or error_uri parameters.
