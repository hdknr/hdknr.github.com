4.  Authorization Grant Example
====================================================

Though non-normative, 
the following examples illustrate what a conforming JWT 
and access token request would look like.

Below is an example JSON object that could be encoded to produce the
JWT Claims Object for a JWT:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {"iss":"https://jwt-idp.example.com",
    "prn":"mailto:mike@example.com",
    "aud":"https://jwt-rp.example.net",
    "nbf":1300815780,
    "exp":1300819380,
    "http://claims.example.com/member":true}

The following example JSON object, 
used as the header of a JWT, 
declares that the JWT is signed with the ECDSA P-256 SHA-256 algorithm.


.. code-block:: javascript

    {"alg":"ES256"}

To present the JWT with the claims and header shown in the previous example 
as part of an access token request, 
for example, 
the client might make the following HTTPS request 
(line breaks are for display purposes only):

::

    POST /token.oauth2 HTTP/1.1
    Host: authz.example.net
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    
    grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Ajwt-
    bearer&assertion=eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiJ9.
