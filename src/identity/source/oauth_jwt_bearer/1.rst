1.  Introduction
============================

JSON Web Token (JWT) [:term:`JWT`] is a JSON-based security token encoding
that enables identity and security information 
to be shared across security domains.  
JWTs utilize JSON data structures, as defined in RFC 4627 [:term:`RFC4627`].  
A security token is generally issued by an identity provider 
and consumed by a relying party that relies on its content 
to identify the token's subject for security related purposes.

The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol [:term:`I-D.ietf.oauth-v2`] 
provides a method for making authenticated HTTP requests 
to a resource using an :term:`access token`.  
:term:`Access tokens` are issued to third-party clients 
by an :term:`authorization server` (AS) 
with the (sometimes implicit) approval of the :term:`resource owner`.  
In OAuth, 
an :term:`authorization grant` is an abstract term used 
to describe **intermediate credentials** 
that represent the :term:`resource owner` authorization.  
An :term:`authorization grant` is used by the :term:`client` 
to obtain an :term:`access token`.  
Several :term:`authorization grant types` are defined 
to support a wide range of client types and user experiences.  
OAuth also allows for the definition of new extension :term:`grant types` 
to support additional clients or to provide a bridge 
between OAuth and other trust frameworks.  
Finally, 
OAuth allows the definition of additional authentication mechanisms 
to be used by clients when interacting with the :term:`authorization server`.

The OAuth 2.0 Assertion Profile [:term:`I-D.ietf.oauth-assertions`] is 
an abstract extension to OAuth 2.0 
that provides a general framework for the use of Assertions 
(a.k.a.  :term:`Security Tokens`) as :term:`client credentials`
and/or :term:`authorization grants` with OAuth 2.0.  
This specification profiles 
the OAuth 2.0 Assertion Profile [:term:`I-D.ietf.oauth-assertions`]
to define an :term:`extension grant type` 
that uses a :doc:`JSON Web Token (JWT) Bearer Token <bearer>` 
to request an OAuth 2.0 :term:`access token` as well as 
for use as :term:`client credentials`.  
The format and processing rules for the JWT defined in this specification 
are intentionally similar, 
though not identical, 
to those in the closely related 
SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion Profiles for OAuth 2.0 [:term:`I-D.ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer`].

This document defines how a :doc:`JSON Web Token (JWT) Bearer Token <bearer>` 
can be used to request an :term:`access token` 
when a client wishes to utilize an existing trust relationship, 
expressed through the semantics of (and digital signature calculated over) the JWT, 
without a direct user approval step at the :term:`authorization server`.  
It also defines how a JWT can be used as a client authentication mechanism.  
The use of a :term:`security token` for :term:`client authentication` is orthogonal 
and separable from using a :term:`security token` as an :term:`authorization grant` 
and the two can be used either in combination or in isolation.

The process by which the client obtains the :term:`JWT`, 
prior to exchanging it with the authorization server 
or using it for client authentication, is out of scope.
