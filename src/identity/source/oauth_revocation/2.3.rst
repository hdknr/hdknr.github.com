2.3.  Cross-Origin Support
---------------------------------------------

The revocation endpoint MAY support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) 
[W3C.WD-cors-20120403] if it is aimed at use in combination with user-agent-based applications.

In addition, for interoperability with legacy user-agents, it MAY
also offer JSONP (Remote JSON - JSONP) [jsonp] by allowing GET
requests with an additional parameter:

.. glossary::

   callback  
        OPTIONAL.  

        The qualified name of a JavaScript function.

For example, 
a client may request the revocation of an access token with the following request 
(line breaks are for display purposes only):

::

     https://example.com/revoke?token=agabcdefddddafdd&callback=package.myCallback



Successful response:

::

     package.myCallback();

Error response:

::

     package.myCallback({"error":"unsupported_token_type"});

Clients should be aware that when relying on JSONP, 
a malicious revocation endpoint may attempt to inject malicious code into the client.
