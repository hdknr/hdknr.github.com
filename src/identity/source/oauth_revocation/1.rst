1.  Introduction
==========================================

The :doc:`OAuth 2.0 core specification <oauth>` [RFC6749] 
defines several ways for a client to obtain refresh and access tokens.  
This specification supplements the core specification 
with a mechanism to revoke both types of tokens.  

A token is a string representing an authorization grant 
issued by the resource owner to the client.  
A revocation request will invalidate the actual token and, 
if applicable, other tokens based on the same authorization grant 
and the authorization grant itself.

From an end-user's perspective, 
OAuth is often used to log into a certain site or application.  
This revocation mechanism allows a client to invalidate its tokens 
if the end-user logs out, changes identity, or uninstalls the respective application.  

Notifying the authorization server that the token is no longer needed 
allows the authorization server to clean up data associated with that token
(e.g., session data) and the underlying authorization grant.  
This behavior prevents a situation 
in which there is still a valid authorization grant for a particular client 
of which the end-user is not aware.  
This way, 
token revocation prevents abuse of abandoned tokens 
and facilitates a better end-user experience 
since invalidated authorization grants will no longer turn up 
in a list of authorization grants the authorization server might present to the end-user.
