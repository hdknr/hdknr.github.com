1. Introduction
============================

The current OAuth 2.0 draft [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] defines several ways
for a client to obtain refresh and access tokens.  
This specification
supplements the draft with a mechanism to revoke both types of tokens
and facilitates the following use cases:

   -  The end-user triggers revocation from within the client that sends
      the appropriate revocation request to the autorization server.
      From the end-user's perspective, this looks like a "logout" or
      "reset" function.  The request causes the removal of the client
      permissions associated with the particular token to access the
      end-user's protected resources.  This use case makes it even more
      comfortable to the end-user to revoke his access grant immediately
      via the client.

   -  In contrast to revocation by a client, the authorization server
      (or a related entity) may offer its end-users a self-care portal
      to delete access grants given to clients independent of any token
      storing devices.  Such a portal offers the possibility to an end-
      user to look at and revoke all access grants he once authorized.
      In cases the token storing device is not available, e.g. it is
      lost or stolen, revocation by a self-care portal is the only
      possibility to limit or avoid abuse.

In the end, security, usability, and ease of use are increased by token revocation.

By using an additional endpoint, 
the token revocation endpoint,
clients can request the revocation of a particular token.  
Compliant implementation MUST support the revocation of refresh tokens, 
access token revocation MAY be supported.
