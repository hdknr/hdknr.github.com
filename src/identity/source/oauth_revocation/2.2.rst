2.2.  Revocation Response
------------------------------------------

The authorization server responds with HTTP status code 200 if the
token has been revoked successfully or if the client submitted an
invalid token.

Note: 
invalid tokens do not cause an error response since the client
cannot handle such an error in a reasonable way.  Moreover, the
purpose of the revocation request, invalidating the particular token,
is already achieved.

The content of the response body is ignored by the client as all
necessary information is conveyed in the response code.

An invalid token type hint value is ignored by the authorization
server and does not influence the revocation response.
