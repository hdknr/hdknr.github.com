2.2.1.  Error Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The error presentation conforms to the definition in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749].  
The following additional error code is defined for the token revocation endpoint:

.. glossary::

   unsupported_token_type  

        The authorization server does not support
        the revocation of the presented token type.  

        That is, 
        the client tried to revoke an access token on a server not
        supporting this feature.

If the server responds with HTTP status code 503, the client must
assume the token still exists and may retry after a reasonable delay.
The server may include a "**Retry-After**" header in the response to
indicate how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the
requesting client.
