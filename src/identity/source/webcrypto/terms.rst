    SOP
    Same Origin Policy
        - Same Origin Policy (SOP), also called Single Origin Policy, 
          is a security measure used in Web browser programming languages 
          such as JavaScript and Ajax to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information. 
          Same Origin Policy prevents a web site's scripts from accessing and interacting 
          with scripts used on other sites.

    Multi-Factor Authentication
        - Multi-factor authentication is as an approach to security authentication, which requires that the user of a system provide more than one form of verification in order to prove their identity and allow access to the system.
          Multi-factor authentication takes advantage of a combination of several factors of authentication; three major factors include verification by something a user knows (such as a password), something the user has (such as a smart card or a security token), and something the user is (such as the use of biometrics). Due to their increased complexity, authentication systems using a multi-factor configuration are harder to compromise than ones using a single factors.
