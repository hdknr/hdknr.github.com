Abstract
=========

The JSON Web Encryption JSON Serialization (JWE-JS) is 
a means of representing encrypted content using JSON data structures. 
This specification describes a means of representing secured content 
as a JSON data object 
(as opposed to the JWE specification, which uses a compact serialization with a URL-safe representation). 

It enables the same content to be encrypted to multiple parties (unlike JWE). 
Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers used with this specification are enumerated 
in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (:doc:`JWA`) specification. 

The JSON Serialization for related digital signature and 
HMAC functionality is described 
in the separate JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization (:doc:`JWS-JS <jws_js>`) specification.
