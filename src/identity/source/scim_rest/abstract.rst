Abstract
==========

The Simple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM) specification 
is designed to make managing user identity in cloud based applications and services easier. 

The specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, 
placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, 
while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. 

It's intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations 
by providing a common user schema and extension model, 
as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema 
using standard protocols. 

In essence, 
make it fast, 
cheap, 
and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the cloud.
