2.  Authentication and Authorization
==================================================

The SCIM protocol does not define a scheme for authentication and authorization 
therefore implementers are free to choose mechanisms appropriate to their use cases. 

The choice of authentication mechanism will impact interoperability. 
It is RECOMMENDED that clients be implemented in such a way that new authentication schemes can be deployed. 
Implementers SHOULD support existing authentication/authorization schemes. 
In particular, 
:doc:`OAuth2 Bearer Token <oauth_bearer>` is RECOMMENDED. 
Appropriate security considerations of the selected authentication and authorization schemes SHOULD be taken. Because this protocol uses HTTP response status codes as the primary means of reporting the result of a request, servers are advised to respond to unauthorized or unauthenticated requests using the 401 response code in accordance with section 10.4.2 of RFC2616.

All examples assume OAuth2 bearer token; e.g.,

::

    GET /Users/2819c223-7f76-453a-919d-413861904646 HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Authorization: Bearer h480djs93hd8

The context of the request (i.e. the user for whom data is being requested) MUST be inferred by Service Providers. 

(draft 01 )

.. note::

    - SCIM REST = Authorization-protected Identity API sets, which require OAuth2 Bearer Tokens.
