1.  Introduction
===================================

The need for documenting the OAuth use cases was discussed 
at the oauth WG virtual meetings, on the group's mailing list, 
and at the IETF 77 and IETF 78.  
This Internet-Draft describes such use cases.
The objective of the draft is to document the discussed OAuth use cases 
and identify the use cases supported by the OAuth specifications.  
The following section provides the abbreviated descriptions of the use cases.

Note: The use of the string ".example.com" in the URLs of the example
entities does not mean that the entities belong to the same organization.
