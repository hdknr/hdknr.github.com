6.3.2. Parameters for RSA Private Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


   In addition to the members used to represent RSA public keys, the
   following members are used to represent RSA private keys.  The
   parameter "d" is REQUIRED for RSA private keys.  The others enable
   optimizations and SHOULD be included by producers of JWKs
   representing RSA private keys.  If the producer includes any of the
   other private key parameters, then all of the others MUST be present,
   with the exception of "oth", which MUST only be present when more
   than two prime factors were used.  The consumer of a JWK MAY choose
   to accept an RSA private key that does not contain a complete set of
   the private key parameters other than "d", including JWKs in which
   "d" is the only RSA private key parameter included.
