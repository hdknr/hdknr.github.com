6.3.1.1. "n" (Modulus) Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "n" (:term:`modulus`) member contains the modulus value for the RSA
public key.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of the
value's unsigned big endian representation as an octet sequence.  The
octet sequence MUST utilize the minimum number of octets to represent
the value.
