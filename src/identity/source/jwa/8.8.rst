8.8.  Password Considerations
------------------------------------------------

Passwords are vulnerable to a number of attacks.  To help mitigate
some of these limitations, this document applies principles from
:rfc:`2898` [RFC2898] to derive cryptographic keys 
from user-supplied passwords.

However, the strength of the password still has a significant impact.
A high-entropy password has greater resistance to dictionary attacks.
[NIST-800-63-1] contains guidelines for estimating password entropy,
which can help applications and users generate stronger passwords.

An ideal password is one that is as large as (or larger than) the
derived key length.  However, passwords larger than a certain
algorithm-specific size are first hashed, which reduces an attacker's
effective search space to the length of the hash algorithm.  It is
RECOMMENDED that a password used for "PBES2-HS256+A128KW" be no
shorter than 16 octets and no longer than 128 octets and a password
used for "PBES2-HS512+A256KW" be no shorter than 32 octets and no
longer than 128 octets long.

Still, care needs to be taken in where and how password-based
encryption is used.  These algorithms can still be susceptible to
dictionary-based attacks if the iteration count is too small; this is
of particular concern if these algorithms are used to protect data
that an attacker can have indefinite number of attempts to circumvent
the protection, such as protected data stored on a file system.
