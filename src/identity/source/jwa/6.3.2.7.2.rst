6.3.2.7.2. "d" (Factor CRT Exponent)
################################################


   The "d" (Factor CRT Exponent) parameter within an "oth" array member
   represents the CRT exponent of the corresponding prime factor, a
   positive integer.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of the
   value's unsigned big endian representation as an octet sequence.  The
   octet sequence MUST utilize the minimum number of octets to represent
   the value.
