7.6.1. Registration Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


   Curve Name:
      The name requested (e.g., "example").  Because a core goal of this
      specification is for the resulting representations to be compact,
      it is RECOMMENDED that the name be short -- not to exceed 8
      characters without a compelling reason to do so.  This name is
      case-sensitive.  Names may not match other registered names in a
      case-insensitive manner unless the Designated Expert(s) state that
      there is a compelling reason to allow an exception in this
      particular case.

   Curve Description:
      Brief description of the curve (e.g., "Example description").

   JOSE Implementation Requirements:
      The curve implementation requirements for JWS and JWE, which must
      be one the words Required, Recommended, Optional, Deprecated, or
      Prohibited.  Optionally, the word can be followed by a "+" or "-".
      The use of "+" indicates that the requirement strength is likely
      to be increased in a future version of the specification.  The use
      of "-" indicates that the requirement strength is likely to be
      decreased in a future version of the specification.

   Change Controller:
      For Standards Track RFCs, state "IESG".  For others, give the name
      of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal address,
      email address, home page URI) may also be included.

   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document(s) that specify the parameter,
      preferably including URI(s) that can be used to retrieve copies of
      the document(s).  An indication of the relevant sections may also
      be included but is not required.
