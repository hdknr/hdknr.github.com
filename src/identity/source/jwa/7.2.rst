7.2.  Password Considerations
---------------------------------------

While convenient for end users, passwords are vulnerable to a number
of attacks.  To help mitigate some of these limitations, this
document applies principles from [RFC2898] to derive cryptographic
keys from user-supplied passwords.

However, the strength of the password still has a significant impact.
A high-entry password has greater resistance to dictionary attacks.
[NIST-800-63-1] contains guidelines for estimating password entropy,
which can help applications and users generate stronger passwords.

An ideal password is one that is as large (or larger) than the
derived key length but less than the PRF's block size.  Passwords
larger than the PRF's block size are first hashed, which reduces an
attacker's effective search space to the length of the hash algorithm
(32 octets for HMAC SHA-256).  It is RECOMMENDED that the password be
no longer than 64 octets long for "PBES2-HS256+A256KW".

Still, care needs to be taken in where and how password-based
encryption is used.  Such algorithms MUST NOT be used where the
attacker can make an indefinite number of attempts to circumvent the
protection.
