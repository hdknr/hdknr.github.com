4.11.  Plaintext Encryption with AES GCM
--------------------------------------------------------

This section defines the specifics of encrypting the JWE Plaintext
with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)
[AES] [NIST.800-38D] using 128, 192, or 256 bit keys.  The "enc"
header parameter values "A128GCM", "A192GCM", or "A256GCM" are
respectively used in this case.

The CEK is used as the encryption key.

Use of an initialization vector of size 96 bits is REQUIRED with this
algorithm.

The Additional Authenticated Data value used is the octets of the
ASCII representation of the Encoded JWE Header value.

The requested size of the Authentication Tag output MUST be 128 bits,
regardless of the key size.

The JWE Authentication Tag is set to be the Authentication Tag value
produced by the encryption.  During decryption, the received JWE
Authentication Tag is used as the Authentication Tag value.

An example using this algorithm is shown in Appendix A.1 of [JWE].
