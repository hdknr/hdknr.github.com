4.9.1.1.  "p2s" (PBES2 salt) Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "p2s" (PBES2 salt) header parameter contains the PBKDF2 salt
value (s) as a base64url encoded string.  This value MUST NOT be the
empty string.  This Header Parameter is REQUIRED and MUST be
understood and processed by implementations when these algorithms are
used.

The salt expands the possible keys that can be derived from a given
password.  [RFC2898] originally recommended a minimum salt length of
8 octets (since there is no concern here of a derived key being re-
used for different purposes).  The salt MUST be generated randomly;
see [RFC4086] for considerations on generating random values.
