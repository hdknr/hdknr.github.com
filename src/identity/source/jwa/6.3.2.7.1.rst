6.3.2.7.1. "r" (Prime Factor)
##########################################


   The "r" (:term:`prime factor`) parameter within an "oth" array member
   represents the value of a subsequent prime factor, a positive
   integer.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of the value's
   unsigned big endian representation as an octet sequence.  The octet
   sequence MUST utilize the minimum number of octets to represent the
   value.
