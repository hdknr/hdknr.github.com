4.10. Additional Encryption Algorithms and Parameters
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional algorithms MAY be used to protect JWEs with corresponding
"alg" (algorithm) and "enc" (encryption method) header parameter
values being defined to refer to them.  New "alg" and "enc" header
parameter values SHOULD either be registered in the IANA JSON Web
Signature and Encryption Algorithms registry Section 6.1 
or be a URI that contains a Collision Resistant Namespace.  
In particular, it is
permissible to use the algorithm identifiers defined in 
:term:`XML Encryption` :term:`[W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210]`, 
XML Encryption 1.1 :term:`[W3C.CR-xmlenc-core1-20120313]`, 
and related specifications as "alg" and "enc" values.

As indicated by the common registry, JWSs and JWEs share a common
"alg" value space.  The values used by the two specifications MUST be
distinct, as the "alg" value MAY be used to determine whether the
object is a JWS or JWE.

Likewise, additional reserved header parameter names MAY be defined
via the IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Header Parameters
registry [JWS].  As indicated by the common registry, JWSs and JWEs
share a common header parameter space; when a parameter is used by
both specifications, its usage must be compatible between the
specifications.
