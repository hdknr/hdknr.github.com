4.10. AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 Algorithms
------------------------------------------------------------

This section defines a family of authenticated encryption algorithms
built using a composition of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with PKCS #5 padding [AES] 
[NIST.800-38A] operations and HMAC [RFC2104] [SHS] operations.  

This algorithm family is called AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2.  
It also defines two instances of this family, 
one using 128 bit CBC keys and HMAC SHA-256 
and the other using 256 bit CBC keys and HMAC SHA-512.  

Test cases for these algorithms can be found in Appendix C.

These algorithms are based upon Authenticated Encryption 
with AES-CBC and HMAC-SHA [I-D.mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2], 
performing the same cryptographic computations, 
but with the :term:`Initialization Vector` and :term:`Authentication Tag` values 
remaining separate, 
rather than being concatenated with the Ciphertext value in the output representation.

This algorithm family is a generalization of the algorithm family 
in [I-D.mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2], 
and can be used to implement those algorithms.
