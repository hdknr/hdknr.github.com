6.4. Parameters for Symmetric Keys
----------------------------------------------------------------


When the JWK "kty" member value is "oct" (octet sequence), 
the member "k" is used to represent a symmetric key 
(or another key whose value is a single octet sequence).  

An "alg" member SHOULD also be present 
to identify the algorithm intended to be used with the key, 
unless the application uses another means 
or convention to determine the algorithm used.
