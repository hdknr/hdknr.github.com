4.8.1.2. "p2c" (PBES2 count) Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "p2c" (PBES2 count) Header Parameter contains 
the PBKDF2 iteration count, 
represented as a positive integer.  

This Header Parameter MUST be present 
and MUST be understood and processed 
by implementations when these algorithms are used.

The iteration count adds computational expense, 
ideally compounded by the possible range of keys 
introduced by the salt.  

A minimum iteration count of 1000 is RECOMMENDED.
