6.2.1.3. "y" (Y Coordinate) Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "y" (y coordinate) member contains the y coordinate for the
elliptic curve point.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of
the octet string representation of the coordinate, as defined in
Section 2.3.5 of SEC1 [SEC1].  The length of this octet string MUST
be the full size of a coordinate for the curve specified in the "crv"
parameter.  

For example, if the value of "crv" is "P-521", the octet
string must be 66 octets long.
