5.  IANA Considerations
==========================================

This specification calls for:

A new IANA registry entitled "JSON Web Signature Algorithms" for values of the JWS alg (algorithm) header parameter is defined in Section 3.4. Inclusion in the registry is RFC Required in the RFC 5226 [RFC5226] sense. The registry will just record the alg value and a pointer to the RFC that defines it. This specification defines inclusion of the algorithm values defined in Table 1.
A new IANA registry entitled "JSON Web Encryption Algorithms" for values used with the JWE alg (algorithm) and enc (encryption method) header parameters is defined in Section 4.2. Inclusion in the registry is RFC Required in the RFC 5226 [RFC5226] sense. The registry will record the alg or enc value and a pointer to the RFC that defines it. This specification defines inclusion of the algorithm values defined in Table 2 and Table 3.
