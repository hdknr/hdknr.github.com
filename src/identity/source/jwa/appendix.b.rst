Appendix B. Test Cases for AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 Algorithms
=============================================================================


   The following test cases can be used to validate implementations of
   the :term:`AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2` algorithms defined in Section 5.2.  They are
   also intended to correspond to test cases that may appear in a future
   version of [I-D.mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2], demonstrating that
   the cryptographic computations performed are the same.

   The variable names are those defined in Section 5.2.  All values are
   hexadecimal.
