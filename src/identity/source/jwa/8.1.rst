8.1. Algorithms and Key Sizes will be Deprecated
------------------------------------------------------


   Eventually the algorithms and/or key sizes currently described in
   this specification will no longer be considered sufficiently secure
   and will be deprecated.  Therefore, implementers and deployments must
   be prepared for this eventuality.
