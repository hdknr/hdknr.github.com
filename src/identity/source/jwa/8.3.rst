8.3. RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 Security Considerations
------------------------------------------------


   While Section 8 of RFC 3447 [RFC3447] explicitly calls for people not
   to adopt RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 for new applications and instead requests
   that people transition to RSASSA-PSS, this specification does include
   RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5, for interoperability reasons, because it commonly
   implemented.

   Keys used with RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 must follow the constraints in
   Section 7.2 of RFC 3447 [RFC3447].  In particular, keys with a low
   public key exponent value must not be used.
