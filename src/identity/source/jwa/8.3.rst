8.3. RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 Security Considerations
------------------------------------------------

.. note::
    - PKCS#1.5 は互換性の為にあるので、 基本的にはPSSを使う事

While Section 8 of RFC 3447 [RFC3447] explicitly calls for people not
to adopt RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 for new applications and instead requests
that people transition to RSASSA-PSS, 
this specification does include RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5, for 
interoperability reasons, because it commonly implemented.

Keys used with RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 must follow the constraints 
in Section 7.2 of RFC 3447 [RFC3447].  

In particular, keys with a low public key exponent value must not be used.
