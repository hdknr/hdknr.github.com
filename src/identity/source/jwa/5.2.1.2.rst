5.2.1.2.  "x" (X Coordinate) Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "x" (x coordinate) member contains the x coordinate for the
elliptic curve point.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of
the coordinate's big endian representation as an octet sequence.  The
array representation MUST NOT be shortened to omit any leading zero
octets contained in the value.  For instance, when representing 521
bit integers, the octet sequence to be base64url encoded MUST contain
66 octets, including any leading zero octets.
