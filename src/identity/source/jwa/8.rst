8. Security Considerations
=======================================

All of the security issues that are pertinent to any cryptographic  
must be faced by a JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  

Among these issues are protecting the user's asymmetric private 
and symmetric secret keys,
preventing various attacks, 
and helping avoid mistakes 
such as inadvertently encrypting a message to the wrong recipient.  

The entire list of security considerations is beyond the scope of 
this document, 
but some significant considerations are listed here.

The security considerations in [AES], [DSS], [JWE], [JWK], [JWS],
[NIST.800-38A], [NIST.800-38D], [NIST.800-56A], [RFC2104], [RFC3394],
[RFC3447], [RFC5116], [RFC6090], 
and [SHS] apply to this specification.
