4.9.1.2.  "p2c" (PBES2 count) Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "p2c" (PBES2 count) header parameter contains the PBKDF2
iteration count (c), as an integer.  This value MUST NOT be less than
1, as per [RFC2898].  This Header Parameter is REQUIRED and MUST be
understood and processed by implementations when these algorithms are
used.

The iteration count adds computational expense, ideally compounded by
the possible range of keys introduced by the salt.  [RFC2898]
originally recommended a minimum iteration count of 1000.
