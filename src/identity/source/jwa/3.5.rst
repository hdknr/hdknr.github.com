3.5. Using the Algorithm "none"
----------------------------------------

JWSs MAY also be created that do not provide integrity protection.
Such a JWS is called a "Plaintext JWS".  Plaintext JWSs MUST use the
"alg" value "none", and are formatted identically to other JWSs, but
with an empty JWS Signature value.
