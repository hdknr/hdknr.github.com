6.2.1. Parameters for Elliptic Curve Public Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


An elliptic curve public key is represented by a pair of coordinates
drawn from a finite field, which together define a point on an
elliptic curve.  The following members MUST be present for elliptic
curve public keys:

   o  "crv"

   o  "x"

   o  "y"

SEC1 [SEC1] point compression is not supported for any values.
