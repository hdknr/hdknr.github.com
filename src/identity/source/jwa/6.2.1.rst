6.2.1.  Registration Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   "kty" Parameter Value:
      The name requested (e.g., "example").  This name is case
      sensitive.  Names that match other registered names in a case
      insensitive manner SHOULD NOT be accepted.

   Change Controller:
      For Standards Track RFCs, state "IETF".  For others, give the name
      of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal address,
      email address, home page URI) may also be included.

   Implementation Requirements:
      The algorithm implementation requirements, which must be one the
      words REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, OPTIONAL, or DEPRECATED.  Optionally,
      the word can be followed by a "+" or "-".  The use of "+"
      indicates that the requirement strength is likely to be increased
      in a future version of the specification.  The use of "-"
      indicates that the requirement strength is likely to be decreased
      in a future version of the specification.

   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document(s) that specify the parameter,
      preferably including URI(s) that can be used to retrieve copies of
      the document(s).  An indication of the relevant sections may also
      be included but is not required.
