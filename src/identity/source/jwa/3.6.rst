3.6.  Using the Algorithm "none"
------------------------------------------

JWSs MAY also be created that do not provide integrity protection.

Such a JWS is called a "Plaintext JWS".  

A Plaintext JWS MUST use the "alg" value "none", 
and is formatted identically to other JWSs, 
but MUST use the empty octet sequence as its JWS Signature value.

Receivers MUST verify that the JWS Signature value is 
the empty octet sequence.  

See Section 8.5 for security considerations associated with 
using this algorithm.
