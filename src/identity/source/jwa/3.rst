3.  Cryptographic Algorithms for JWS
============================================================

JWS uses cryptographic algorithms to sign the contents of the JWS Header and the JWS Payload. 
The use of the following algorithms for producing JWSs is defined in this section.

The table below Table 1 is the set of alg (algorithm) header parameter values defined by this specification for use with JWS, each of which is explained in more detail in the following sections:


.. list-table:: Table 1: JWS Defined "alg" Parameter Values 

    *   - Alg Parameter Value 
        - Algorithm

    *   - HS256   
        - HMAC using SHA-256 hash algorithm

    *   - HS384   
        - HMAC using SHA-384 hash algorithm

    *   - HS512   
        - HMAC using SHA-512 hash algorithm

    *   - RS256   
        - RSA using SHA-256 hash algorithm

    *   - RS384   
        - RSA using SHA-384 hash algorithm

    *   - RS512   
        - RSA using SHA-512 hash algorithm

    *   - ES256   
        - ECDSA using P-256 curve and SHA-256 hash algorithm

    *   - ES384   
        - ECDSA using P-384 curve and SHA-384 hash algorithm

    *   - ES512   
        - ECDSA using P-521 curve and SHA-512 hash algorithm

See :ref:`Appendix A <jaw.appendix.a>` for a table cross-referencing 
the digital signature and :term:`HMAC` :term:`alg` (algorithm) values 
used in this specification with the equivalent identifiers used by other standards and software packages.

Of these algorithms, 
only :term:`HMAC` :term:`SHA-256` MUST be implemented by conforming JWS implementations. 

It is RECOMMENDED that 
implementations also support the :term:`RSA` :term:`SHA-256` and :term:`ECDSA` :term:`P-256` :term:`SHA-256` algorithms. 
Support for other algorithms and key sizes is OPTIONAL.
