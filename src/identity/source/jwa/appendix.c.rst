Appendix C.  Test Cases for AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 Algorithms
===============================================================

The following test cases can be used to validate implementations of
the AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 algorithms defined in Section 4.10.  They are
also intended to correspond to test cases that may appear in a future
version of [I-D.mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2], demonstrating that
the cryptographic computations performed are the same.

The variable names are those defined in Section 4.10.  All values are
hexadecimal.
