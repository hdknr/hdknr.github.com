5.1. "alg" (Algorithm Family) Parameter Values for JWK
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

    - ":ref:`RSA <jwa.5.3>`" MUST be implemented.
    - JWK for Elliptic Curve is like this:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
            "alg" : "EC" 
        }

The table below is the set of "alg" (algorithm family) parameter
values that are defined by this specification for use in JWKs.

   +-----------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+
   | alg Parameter   | Algorithm Family        | Implementation        |
   | Value           |                         | Requirements          |
   +-----------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+
   | EC              | Elliptic Curve [DSS]    | RECOMMENDED+          |
   |                 | key family              |                       |
   | RSA             | RSA [RFC3447] key       | REQUIRED              |
   |                 | family                  |                       |
   +-----------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+

All the names are short because a core goal of JWK is for the
representations to be compact.  
However, there is no a priori length restriction on "alg" values.

The use of "+" in the Implementation Requirements indicates that the
requirement strength is likely to be increased in a future version of
the specification.
