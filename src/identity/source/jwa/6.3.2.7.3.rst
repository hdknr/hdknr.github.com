6.3.2.7.3. "t" (Factor CRT Coefficient)
#############################################


   The "t" (factor CRT coefficient) parameter within an "oth" array
   member represents the CRT coefficient of the corresponding prime
   factor, a positive integer.  It is represented as the base64url
   encoding of the value's unsigned big endian representation as an
   octet sequence.  The octet sequence MUST utilize the minimum number
   of octets to represent the value.
