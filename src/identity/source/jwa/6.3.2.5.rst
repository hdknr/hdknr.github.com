6.3.2.5. "dq" (Second Factor CRT Exponent) Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "dq" (second factor CRT exponent) member contains 
the :term:`Chinese Remainder Theorem` (CRT) exponent of the second factor, 
a positive integer.  

It is represented as the base64url encoding of the value's 
unsigned big endian representation as an octet sequence.  

The octet sequence MUST utilize the minimum number of octets 
to represent the value.
