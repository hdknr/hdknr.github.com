5.2.1. "crv" (Curve) Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "crv" (curve) member identifies the cryptographic curve used with
the key.  Curve values from [DSS] used by this specification are:

   -  "P-256"

   -  "P-384"

   -  "P-521"

Additional "crv" values MAY be used, provided they are understood by
implementations using that Elliptic Curve key.  The "crv" value is a
case sensitive string.
