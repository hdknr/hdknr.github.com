8.7.  Reusing Key Material when Encrypting Keys
------------------------------------------------------

It is NOT RECOMMENDED to reuse the same key material 
(Key Encryption Key, Content Encryption Key, Initialization Vector, etc.) 
to encrypt multiple JWK or JWK Set objects, 
or to encrypt the same JWK or JWK

Set object multiple times.  

One suggestion for preventing re-use is
to always generate a new set key material 
for each encryption operation, 
based on the considerations noted 
in this document as well as from :rf:`4086` :term:`[RFC4086]`.
