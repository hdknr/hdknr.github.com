        - 128ビットCBC + HMAC-SHA256
        - 192ビットCBC + HMAC-SHA384
        - 256ビットCBC + HMAC-SHA512

This section defines a family of authenticated encryption algorithms
built using a composition of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode 
with PKCS #7 padding [AES] [NIST.800-38A] operations 
and HMAC [RFC2104] [SHS] operations.  

This algorithm family is called AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2.  

It also defines three instances of this family, 
the first using 128 bit CBC keys and HMAC SHA-256, 
the second using 192 bit CBC keys and HMAC SHA-384, and 
the third using 256 bit CBC keys and HMAC SHA-512.  

Test cases for these algorithms can be found 
in :ref:`Appendix B <jwa.appendix.b>`.

These algorithms are based upon 
Authenticated Encryption with AES-CBC and HMAC-SHA 
[I-D.mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2], 
performing the same cryptographic computations, 
but with the :term:`Initialization Vector` 
and :term:`Authentication Tag` values remaining separate, 
rather than being concatenated with the :term:`Ciphertext` value 
in the output representation.

This option is discussed in :term:`Appendix B <jwa.appendix.b>` 
of that specification.  

This algorithm family is a generalization of the algorithm family 
in [I-D.mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2], 
and can be used to implement those algorithms.
