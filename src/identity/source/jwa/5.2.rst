5.2. AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 Algorithms
------------------------------------------------

This section defines a family of 
authenticated encryption algorithms
built using a composition of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode 
with PKCS #5 padding [AES] [NIST.800-38A] operations 
and HMAC [RFC2104] [SHS] operations.  

This algorithm family is called AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2.  

It also defines three instances of this family, 
the first using :ref:`128 bit CBC keys and HMAC SHA-256 <jwa.5.2.3>`, 
the second using :ref:`192 bit CBC keys and HMAC SHA-384 <jwa.5.2.4>`, and 
the third using :ref:`256 bit CBC keys and HMAC SHA-512 <jwa.5.2.5>`.  

Test cases for these algorithms can be found in :ref:`Appendix B <jwa.appendix.b>`.


These algorithms are based upon Authenticated Encryption 
with AES-CBC and HMAC-SHA [I-D.mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2], 
performing the same cryptographic computations, 
but with the :term:`Initialization Vector` 
and :term:`Authentication Tag` values remaining separate, 
rather than being concatenated with the Ciphertext value 
in the output representation.

This option is discussed in :ref:`Appendix B <jwa.appendix.b>` 
of that specification.  

This algorithm family is a generalization of the algorithm family in
:term:`[I-D.mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2]`, 
and can be used to implement those algorithms.
