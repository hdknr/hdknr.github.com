8.2. Key Lifetimes
----------------------------

Many algorithms have associated security considerations 
related to key lifetimes and/or the number of times that a key may be used.

Those security considerations continue to apply 
when using those algorithms with JOSE data structures.  

See NIST SP 800-57 :term:`[NIST.800-57]` for specific guidance on key lifetimes.
