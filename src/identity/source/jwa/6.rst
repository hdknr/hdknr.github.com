6. Cryptographic Algorithms for Keys
================================================


A JSON Web Key (JWK) [JWK] is a JSON data structure that represents a
cryptographic key.  These keys can be either asymmetric or symmetric.
They can hold both public and private information about the key.
This section defines the parameters for keys using the algorithms
specified by this document.
