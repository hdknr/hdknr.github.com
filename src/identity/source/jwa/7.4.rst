7.4. JSON Web Key Types Registry
---------------------------------------------------------------


   This specification establishes the IANA JSON Web Key Types registry
   for values of the JWK "kty" (key type) parameter.  The registry
   records the "kty" value, implementation requirements, and a reference
   to the specification that defines it.

   The implementation requirements of a key type MAY be changed over
   time by the Designated Experts(s) as the cryptographic landscape
   evolves, for instance, to change the status of a key type to
   Deprecated, or to change the status of a key type from Optional to
   Recommended+ or Required.  Changes of implementation requirements are
   only permitted on a Specification Required basis, with the new
   specification defining the revised implementation requirements level.
