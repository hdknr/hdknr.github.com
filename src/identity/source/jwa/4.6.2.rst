4.6.2. Key Derivation for ECDH Key Agreement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The key derivation process derives the agreed upon key from the
shared secret Z established through the ECDH algorithm, per Section
6.2.2.2 of [NIST.800-56A].

Key derivation is performed using the Concat KDF, as defined in
Section 5.8.1 of [NIST.800-56A], where the Digest Method is SHA-256.
The Concat KDF parameters are set as follows:

.. glossary::

    Z  
        This is set to the representation of the shared secret Z as an
        octet sequence.

    keydatalen  

        This is set to the number of bits in the desired output
        key.  For "ECDH-ES", this is length of the key used by the "enc"
        algorithm.  For "ECDH-ES+A128KW", "ECDH-ES+A192KW", and
        "ECDH-ES+A256KW", this is 128, 192, and 256, respectively.

    AlgorithmID  
        The AlgorithmID value is of the form Datalen || Data,
        where Data is a variable-length string of zero or more octets, and
        Datalen is a fixed-length, big endian 32 bit counter that
        indicates the length (in octets) of Data.  In the Direct Key
        Agreement case, Data is set to the octets of the UTF-8
        representation of the "enc" Header Parameter value.  In the Key
        Agreement with Key Wrapping case, Data is set to the octets of the
        UTF-8 representation of the "alg" Header Parameter value.

    PartyUInfo  
        The PartyUInfo value is of the form Datalen || Data,
        where Data is a variable-length string of zero or more octets, and
        Datalen is a fixed-length, big endian 32 bit counter that
        indicates the length (in octets) of Data.  If an "apu" (agreement
        PartyUInfo) Header Parameter is present, Data is set to the result
        of base64url decoding the "apu" value and Datalen is set to the
        number of octets in Data.  Otherwise, Datalen is set to 0 and Data
        is set to the empty octet sequence.

    PartyVInfo  
        The PartyVInfo value is of the form Datalen || Data,
        where Data is a variable-length string of zero or more octets, and
        Datalen is a fixed-length, big endian 32 bit counter that
        indicates the length (in octets) of Data.  If an "apv" (agreement
        PartyVInfo) Header Parameter is present, Data is set to the result
        of base64url decoding the "apv" value and Datalen is set to the
        number of octets in Data.  Otherwise, Datalen is set to 0 and Data
        is set to the empty octet sequence.


    SuppPubInfo  
        This is set to the keydatalen represented as a 32 bit
        big endian integer.

    SuppPrivInfo  
        This is set to the empty octet sequence.

Applications need to specify how the "apu" and "apv" parameters are
used for that application.  The "apu" and "apv" values MUST be
distinct, when used.  Applications wishing to conform to
[NIST.800-56A] need to provide values that meet the requirements of
that document, e.g., by using values that identify the sender and
recipient.  Alternatively, applications MAY conduct key derivation in
a manner similar to The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Method
[RFC2631]: In that case, the "apu" field MAY either be omitted or
represent a random 512-bit value (analogous to PartyAInfo in
Ephemeral-Static mode in [RFC2631]) and the "apv" field should not be
present.

See Appendix C for an example key agreement computation using this
method.
