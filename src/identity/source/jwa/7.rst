7.  Open Issues and Things To Be Done (TBD)
==================================================

The following items remain to be done in this draft:

- Specify minimum required key sizes for all algorithms.
- Specify which algorithms require Initialization Vectors (IVs) and minimum required lengths for those IVs.
- Since RFC 3447 Section 8 explicitly calls for people NOT to adopt RSASSA-PKCS1 for new applications and instead requests that people transition to RSASSA-PSS, we probably need some Security Considerations text explaining why RSASSA-PKCS1 is being used (it's what's commonly implemented) and what the potential consequences are.
- Should we define the use of RFC 5649 key wrapping functions, which allow arbitrary key sizes, in addition to the current use of RFC 3394 key wrapping functions, which require that keys be multiples of 64 bits? Is this needed in practice?
- Decide whether to move the JWK algorithm family definitions "EC" and "RSA" here. This would likely result in all the family-specific parameter definitions also moving here ("crv", "x", "y", "mod", "exp"), leaving very little normative text in the JWK spec itself. This seems like it would reduce spec readability and so was not done.
- It would be good to say somewhere, in normative language, that eventually the algorithms and/or key sizes currently specified will no longer be considered sufficiently secure and will be removed. Therefore, implementers MUST be prepared for this eventuality.
- Write the Security Considerations section.
