6.3.1.2. "e" (Exponent) Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The "e" (:term:`exponent`) member contains the exponent value for the RSA
public key.  It is represented as the :term:`base64url encoding` of the
value's unsigned big endian representation as an octet sequence.  The
octet sequence MUST utilize the minimum number of octets to represent
the value.  

For instance, when representing the value 65537, the
octet sequence to be base64url encoded MUST consist of the three
octets [1, 0, 1].
