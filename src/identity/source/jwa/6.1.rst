6.1.  JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms Registry
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This specification establishes the IANA JSON Web Signature and
Encryption Algorithms registry for values of the JWS and JWE "alg"
(algorithm) and "enc" (encryption method) header parameters.  The
registry records the algorithm name, the algorithm usage locations
from the set "alg" and "enc", implementation requirements, and a
reference to the specification that defines it.  The same algorithm
name MAY be registered multiple times, provided that the sets of
usage locations are disjoint.  The implementation requirements of an
algorithm MAY be changed over time by the Designated Experts(s) as
the cryptographic landscape evolves, for instance, to change the
status of an algorithm to DEPRECATED, or to change the status of an
algorithm from OPTIONAL to RECOMMENDED or REQUIRED.
