4.5. Direct Encryption with a Shared Symmetric Key
---------------------------------------------------------

This section defines the specifics of directly performing symmetric
key encryption without performing a key wrapping step.  In this case,
the shared symmetric key is used directly as the Content Encryption
Key (CEK) value for the "enc" algorithm.  An empty octet sequence is
used as the JWE Encrypted Key value.  The "alg" Header Parameter
value "dir" is used in this case.

Refer to the security considerations on key lifetimes in Section 8.2
and AES GCM in Section 8.4 when considering utilizing direct
encryption.
