8.4. AES GCM Security Considerations
----------------------------------------------------


   Keys used with AES GCM must follow the constraints in Section 8.3 of
   [NIST.800-38D], which states: "The total number of invocations of the
   authenticated encryption function shall not exceed 2^32, including
   all IV lengths and all instances of the authenticated encryption
   function with the given key".  In accordance with this rule, AES GCM
   MUST NOT be used with the same key value more than 2^32 times.


   An Initialization Vector value MUST never be used multiple times with
   the same AES GCM key.  One way to prevent this is to store a counter
   with the key and increment it with every use.  The counter can also
   be used to prevent exceeding the 2^32 limit above.

   This security consideration does not apply to the composite AES-CBC
   HMAC SHA-2 or AES Key Wrap algorithms.
