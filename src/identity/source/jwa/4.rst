4.  Cryptographic Algorithms for JWE
=============================================

JWE uses cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the :term:`Content Encryption Key` (:term:`CEK`) and the :term:`Plaintext`. 
This section specifies a set of specific algorithms for these purposes.

The table below Table 2 is the set of alg (algorithm) header parameter values that are defined by this specification for use with JWE. These algorithms are used to encrypt the CEK, which produces the JWE Encrypted Key.

.. list-table::  Table 2: JWE Defined "alg" Parameter Values 
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - alg Parameter Value 
        - Encryption Algorithm

    *   - RSA1_5  
        - RSA using RSA-PKCS1-1.5 padding, as defined in RFC 3447 [RFC3447]

    *   - RSA-OAEP    
        - RSA using Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP), as defined in RFC 3447 [RFC3447]

    *   - ECDH-ES 
        - Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Static, as defined in RFC 6090 [RFC6090], 
          and using the Concat KDF, as defined in [NIST‑800‑56A], 
          where the Digest Method is SHA-256

    *   - A128KW  
        - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Key Wrap Algorithm using 128 bit keys, as defined in RFC 3394 [RFC3394]

    *   - A256KW  
        - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Key Wrap Algorithm using 256 bit keys, as defined in RFC 3394 [RFC3394]

    *   - A128GCM 
        - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using 128 bit keys in Galois/Counter Mode, as defined in [FIPS‑197] and [NIST‑800‑38D]

    *   - A256GCM 
        - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using 256 bit keys in Galois/Counter Mode, as defined in [FIPS‑197] and [NIST‑800‑38D]

The table below Table 3 is the set of enc (encryption method) header parameter values that are defined by this specification for use with JWE. These algorithms are used to encrypt the Plaintext, which produces the Ciphertext.


.. list-table::  Table 3: JWE Defined "enc" Parameter Values 

    *   - enc Parameter Value 
        - Symmetric Encryption Algorithm

    *   - A128CBC 
        - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using 128 bit keys in Cipher Block Chaining mode, as defined in [FIPS‑197] and [NIST‑800‑38A]

    *   - A256CBC 
        - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using 256 bit keys in Cipher Block Chaining mode, as defined in [FIPS‑197] and [NIST‑800‑38A]

    *   - A128GCM 
        - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using 128 bit keys in Galois/Counter Mode, as defined in [FIPS‑197] and [NIST‑800‑38D]
   
    *   - A256GCM 
        - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using 256 bit keys in Galois/Counter Mode, as defined in [FIPS‑197] and [NIST‑800‑38D]

See Appendix B for a table cross-referencing the encryption alg (algorithm) and 
alg (encryption method) values used in this specification with the equivalent identifiers used by other standards and software packages.

Of these algorithms, only :term:`RSA-PKCS1-1.5` with 2048 bit keys, AES-128-CBC, and AES-256-CBC MUST be implemented by conforming JWE implementations. 
It is RECOMMENDED that implementations also support ECDH-ES with 256 bit keys, AES-128-GCM, and AES-256-GCM. Support for other algorithms and key sizes is OPTIONAL.
