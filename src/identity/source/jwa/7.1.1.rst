7.1.1. Registration Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Algorithm Name:
      The name requested (e.g., "example").  This name is case-
      sensitive.  Names may not match other registered names in a case-
      insensitive manner unless the Designated Expert(s) state that
      there is a compelling reason to allow an exception in this
      particular case.

   Algorithm Description:
      Brief description of the Algorithm (e.g., "Example description").

   Algorithm Usage Location(s):
      The algorithm usage location.  This must be one or more of the
      values "alg" or "enc" if the algorithm is to be used with JWS or
      JWE.  The value "JWK" is used if the algorithm identifier will be
      used as a JWK "alg" member value, but will not be used with JWS or
      JWE; this could be the case, for instance, for non-authenticated
      encryption algorithms.  Other values may be used with the approval
      of a Designated Expert.

   JOSE Implementation Requirements:
      The algorithm implementation requirements for JWS and JWE, which
      must be one the words Required, Recommended, Optional, Deprecated,
      or Prohibited.  Optionally, the word can be followed by a "+" or
      "-".  The use of "+" indicates that the requirement strength is
      likely to be increased in a future version of the specification.
      The use of "-" indicates that the requirement strength is likely
      to be decreased in a future version of the specification.  Any
      identifiers registered for non-authenticated encryption algorithms
      or other algorithms that are otherwise unsuitable for direct use
      as JWS or JWE algorithms must be registered as "Prohibited".

   Change Controller:
      For Standards Track RFCs, state "IESG".  For others, give the name
      of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal address,
      email address, home page URI) may also be included.

   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document(s) that specify the parameter,
      preferably including URI(s) that can be used to retrieve copies of
      the document(s).  An indication of the relevant sections may also
      be included but is not required.
