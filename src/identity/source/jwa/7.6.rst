7.6. JSON Web Key Elliptic Curve Registry
----------------------------------------------------


   This specification establishes the IANA JSON Web Key Elliptic Curve
   registry for JWK "crv" member values.  The registry records the curve
   name, implementation requirements, and a reference to the
   specification that defines it.  This specification registers the
   parameter names defined in Section 6.2.1.1.

   The implementation requirements of a curve MAY be changed over time
   by the Designated Experts(s) as the cryptographic landscape evolves,
   for instance, to change the status of a curve to Deprecated, or to
   change the status of a curve from Optional to Recommended+ or
   Required.  Changes of implementation requirements are only permitted
   on a Specification Required basis, with the new specification
   defining the revised implementation requirements level.
