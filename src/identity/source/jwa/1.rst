1.  Introduction
===================


The JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification 
enumerates cryptographic algorithms and identifiers 
to be used with 
the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS], 
JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE], 
and JSON Web Key (JWK) [JWK] specifications.  
All these specifications utilize 
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] based data structures.  
This specification also describes the semantics and operations 
that are specific to these algorithms and algorithm families.


Enumerating the algorithms and identifiers for them in this specification, 
rather than in the JWS, JWE, and JWK specifications,
is intended to allow them to remain unchanged in the face of changes
in the set of required, recommended, optional, and deprecated algorithms over time.
