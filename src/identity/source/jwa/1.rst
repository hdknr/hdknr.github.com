1.  Introduction
===================

The JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification 
enumerates cryptographic algorithms and identifiers 
to be used with the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [:term:`JWS`] and JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [:term:`JWE`] specifications. 

Enumerating the algorithms and identifiers for them in this specification, 
rather than in the JWS and JWE specifications, 
is intended to allow them to remain unchanged in the face of changes in the set of required, 
recommended, optional, and deprecated algorithms over time. 

This specification also describes the semantics and operations that are specific to these algorithms and algorithm families.
