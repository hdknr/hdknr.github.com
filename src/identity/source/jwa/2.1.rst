2.1. Terms Incorporated from the JWS Specification
----------------------------------------------------------------------

These terms defined by the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS]
specification are incorporated into this specification:

.. glossary::

   JWS
   JSON Web Signature
   JSON Web Signature (JWS)  
      A data structure cryptographically securing
      a JWS Header and a JWS Payload with a JWS Signature value.

   JWS Header
      A string representing a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
      [RFC4627] object that describes the digital signature or MAC
      operation applied to create the JWS Signature value.

   JWS Payload
      The bytes to be secured - a.k.a., the message.  The
      payload can contain an arbitrary sequence of bytes.

   JWS Signature
      A byte array containing the cryptographic material
      that secures the contents of the JWS Header and the JWS Payload.

   Base64url Encoding
      The URL- and filename-safe Base64 encoding
      described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648], Section 5, with the (non URL-
      safe) '=' padding characters omitted, as permitted by Section 3.2.
      (See Appendix C of [JWS] for notes on implementing base64url
      encoding without padding.)

   Encoded JWS Header
      Base64url encoding of the bytes of the UTF-8
      [RFC3629] representation of the JWS Header.

   Encoded JWS Payload
      Base64url encoding of the JWS Payload.

   Encoded JWS Signature
      Base64url encoding of the JWS Signature.

   JWS Secured Input
      The concatenation of the Encoded JWS Header, a
      period ('.') character, and the Encoded JWS Payload.

   Collision Resistant Namespace
      A namespace that allows names to be
      allocated in a manner such that they are highly unlikely to
      collide with other names.  For instance, collision resistance can
      be achieved through administrative delegation of portions of the
      namespace or through use of collision-resistant name allocation
      functions.  Examples of Collision Resistant Namespaces include:
      Domain Names, Object Identifiers (OIDs) as defined in the ITU-T
      X.660 and X.670 Recommendation series, and Universally Unique
      IDentifiers (UUIDs) [RFC4122].  When using an administratively
      delegated namespace, the definer of a name needs to take
      reasonable precautions to ensure they are in control of the
      portion of the namespace they use to define the name.
