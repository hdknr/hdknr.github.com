6.2.1.1. "crv" (Curve) Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "crv" (curve) member identifies the cryptographic curve used with
the key.  Curve values from [DSS] used by this specification are:

   o  "P-256"

   o  "P-384"

   o  "P-521"

These values are registered in the IANA JSON Web Key Elliptic Curve
registry defined in Section 7.6.  Additional "crv" values MAY be
used, provided they are understood by implementations using that
Elliptic Curve key.  The "crv" value is a case-sensitive string.
