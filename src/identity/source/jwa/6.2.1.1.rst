6.2.1.1. "crv" (Curve) Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "crv" (curve) member identifies 
the cryptographic curve used with the key.  

Curve values from :term:`[DSS]` used by this specification are:

-  "P-256"
-  "P-384"
-  "P-521"

These values are registered 
in the :term:`IANA JSON Web Key Elliptic Curve` registry 
defined in :ref:`Section 7.6 <jwa.7.6>`.  

Additional "crv" values MAY be used, 
provided they are understood by implementations using that
Elliptic Curve key.  

The "crv" value is a case-sensitive string.
