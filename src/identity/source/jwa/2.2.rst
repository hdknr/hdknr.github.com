2.2. Terms Incorporated from the JWE Specification
------------------------------------------------------------

These terms defined by the JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE]
specification are incorporated into this specification:

   JWE
   JSON Web Encryption
   JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
      A data structure representing an encrypted
      version of a Plaintext.  The structure consists of four parts: the
      JWE Header, the JWE Encrypted Key, the JWE Ciphertext, and the JWE
      Integrity Value.

   Plaintext
      The bytes to be encrypted - a.k.a., the message.  The
      plaintext can contain an arbitrary sequence of bytes.

   Ciphertext
      The encrypted version of the Plaintext.

   CEK
   Content Encryption Key
   Content Encryption Key (CEK)
      A symmetric key used to encrypt the
      Plaintext for the recipient to produce the Ciphertext.

   CIK
   Content Integrity Key
   Content Integrity Key (CIK)
      A key used with a MAC function to ensure
      the integrity of the Ciphertext and the parameters used to create
      it.

   CMK
   Content Master Key
   Content Master Key (CMK)
      A key from which the CEK and CIK are
      derived.  When key wrapping or key encryption are employed, the
      CMK is randomly generated and encrypted to the recipient as the
      JWE Encrypted Key. When key agreement is employed, the CMK is the
      result of the key agreement algorithm.

   JWE Header
      A string representing a JSON object that describes the
      encryption operations applied to create the JWE Encrypted Key, the
      JWE Ciphertext, and the JWE Integrity Value.

   JWE Encrypted Key
      When key wrapping or key encryption are employed,
      the Content Master Key (CMK) is encrypted with the intended
      recipient's key and the resulting encrypted content is recorded as
      a byte array, which is referred to as the JWE Encrypted Key.
      Otherwise, when key agreement is employed, the JWE Encrypted Key
      is the empty byte array.

   JWE Ciphertext
      A byte array containing the Ciphertext.

   JWE Integrity Value
      A byte array containing a MAC value that ensures
      the integrity of the Ciphertext and the parameters used to create
      it.

   Encoded JWE Header
      Base64url encoding of the bytes of the UTF-8
      [RFC3629] representation of the JWE Header.

   Encoded JWE Encrypted Key
      Base64url encoding of the JWE Encrypted
      Key.

   Encoded JWE Ciphertext
      Base64url encoding of the JWE Ciphertext.

   Encoded JWE Integrity Value
      Base64url encoding of the JWE Integrity
      Value.

   AEAD Algorithm
      An Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
      (AEAD) [RFC5116] encryption algorithm is one that provides an
      integrated content integrity check.  AES Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)
      is one such algorithm.
