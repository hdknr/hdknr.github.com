8.6.  Denial of Service Attacks
---------------------------------------

Receiving agents that validate signatures and sending agents that
encrypt messages need to be cautious of cryptographic processing
usage when validating signatures and encrypting messages using keys
larger than those mandated in this specification.  An attacker could
send certificates with keys that would result in excessive
cryptographic processing, for example, keys larger than those
mandated in this specification, which could swamp the processing
element.  Agents that use such keys without first validating the
certificate to a trust anchor are advised to have some sort of
cryptographic resource management system to prevent such attacks.
