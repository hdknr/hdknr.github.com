8.6. Differences between Digital Signatures and MACs
---------------------------------------------------------------


While in many cases, MACs and digital signatures can be used for
integrity checking, there are some significant differences between
the security properties that each of them provides.  These need to be
taken into consideration when designing protocols and selecting the
algorithms to be used in protocols.


Both signatures and MACs provide for integrity checking -- 
verifying that the message has not been modified 
since the integrity value was computed.  

However, 
MACs provide for origination identification only under specific circumstances.  
It can normally be assumed 
that a private key used for a signature is only in the hands of a single entity 
(although perhaps a distributed entity, in the case of replicated servers); 
however, 
a MAC key needs to be in the hands of all the entities 
that use it for integrity computation and checking.

This means that origination can only be determined 
if a MAC key is known only to two entities 
and the receiver knows that it did not create the message.  
MAC validation cannot be used to prove origination to a third party.
