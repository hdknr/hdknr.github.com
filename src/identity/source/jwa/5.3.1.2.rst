5.3.1.2. "e" (Exponent) Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "e" (exponent) member contains the exponent value 
for the RSA **public key**.  

It is represented as the :term:`base64url encoding` of 
the value's **unsigned big endian** representation as an octet sequence.  

The array representation MUST utilize the minimum number of octets to
represent the value.  

For instance, 
when representing the value 65537, 
the octet sequence to be base64url encoded MUST consist of the three octets [1, 0, 1].
