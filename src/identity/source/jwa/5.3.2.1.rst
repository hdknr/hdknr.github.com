5.3.2.1.  "d" (Private Exponent) Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "d" (**private exponent**) member contains 
the private exponent value for the RSA **private key**.  

It is represented as the base64url encoding
of the value's unsigned big endian representation as an octet
sequence.  
The array representation MUST NOT be shortened to omit any
leading zero octets.  For instance, when representing 2048 bit
integers, the octet sequence to be base64url encoded MUST contain 256
octets, including any leading zero octets.
