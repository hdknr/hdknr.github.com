~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "dp" (first CRT coefficient) member contains the 
:term:`Chinese Remainder Theorem` (CRT) :term:`coefficient` of the second factor, 
a positive integer.  

It is represented as the base64url encoding of the value's
unsigned big endian representation as an octet sequence.  The octet
sequence MUST utilize the minimum number of octets to represent the
