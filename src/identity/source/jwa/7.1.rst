7.1. JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms Registry
---------------------------------------------------------------------


   This specification establishes the IANA JSON Web Signature and
   Encryption Algorithms registry for values of the JWS and JWE "alg"
   (algorithm) and "enc" (encryption algorithm) Header Parameters.  The
   registry records the algorithm name, the algorithm usage locations,
   implementation requirements, and a reference to the specification
   that defines it.  The same algorithm name can be registered multiple
   times, provided that the sets of usage locations are disjoint.

   It is suggested that when algorithms can use keys of different
   lengths, that the length of the key be included in the algorithm
   name.  This allows readers of the JSON text to easily make security
   consideration decisions.

   The implementation requirements of an algorithm MAY be changed over
   time by the Designated Experts(s) as the cryptographic landscape
   evolves, for instance, to change the status of an algorithm to
   Deprecated, or to change the status of an algorithm from Optional to
   Recommended+ or Required.  Changes of implementation requirements are
   only permitted on a Specification Required basis, with the new
   specification defining the revised implementation requirements level.
