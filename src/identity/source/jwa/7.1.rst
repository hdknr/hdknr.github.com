7.1.  Reusing Key Material when Encrypting Keys
------------------------------------------------------------------

It is NOT RECOMMENDED to reuse the same key material 
( :term:`Key Encryption Key`, :term:`Content Master Key`, :term:`Initialization Vector`, etc.) 
to encrypt multiple JWK or JWK Set objects, or to encrypt the same JWK or JWK
Set object multiple times.  

One suggestion for preventing re-use is to always generate a new set key material 
for each encryption operation, 
based on the considerations noted in this document as well as from [RFC4086].
