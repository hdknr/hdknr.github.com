5.2.2.1.  "d" (ECC Private Key) Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "d" (ECC private key) member contains the Elliptic Curve private
key value.  It is represented as the base64url encoding of the
value's unsigned big endian representation as an octet sequence.  The
array representation MUST NOT be shortened to omit any leading zero
octets.  For instance, when representing 521 bit integers, the octet
sequence to be base64url encoded MUST contain 66 octets, including
any leading zero octets.
