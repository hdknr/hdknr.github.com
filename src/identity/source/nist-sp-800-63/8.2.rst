8.2. Authentication Mechanism Requirements
--------------------------------------------------

.. note::

    Level of Assurance is lowest level reached for 5 metrics 

        -   Registration and Issuance 
        -   Tokens 
        -   Token and Credential Management
        -   Authentication Process 
        -   Assertions

This section covers the mechanical authentication process of a claimant who already has registered a token. 
Identity proofing and registration are dealt with separately in Section 7. 
The authentication process shall provide sufficient information to the relying party 
to uniquely identify the registration information 
provided by the subscriber and verified by the :term:`RA` in the issuance of the credential.

Four assurance levels are defined, numbered 1 to 4. 
Level 4 provides the highest level of authentication assurance, 
while Level 1 provides the least assurance. 
The technical requirements for authentication mechanisms (tokens, protocols and security protections) are stated in this section.
