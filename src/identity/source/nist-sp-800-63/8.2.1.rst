8.2.1. Level 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Although there is no identity proofing requirement at this level, 
the authentication mechanism provides some assurance that the same claimant is accessing the protected transaction or data. 
It allows a wide range of available authentication technologies to be employed 
and permits the use of any token methods of Levels 2, 3 or 4. 

Successful authentication requires that the :term:`claimant`  shall prove, 
through a secure authentication protocol, that he/she controls the token.

Plaintext passwords or secrets shall not be transmitted across a network at Level 1. 
However this level does not require cryptographic methods that block offline analysis by eavesdroppers. 

For example, password challenge-response protocols 
that combine a password with a challenge to generate an authentication reply satisfy this requirement 
although an eavesdropper who intercepts the challenge 
and reply may be able to conduct a successful off-line dictionary or password exhaustion attack 
and recover the password. 

Common protocols that meet Level 1 requirements include APOP [RFC 1939], S/KEY [SKEY], and Kerberos [KERB]. 
Since an eavesdropper who intercepts such a protocol exchange will often be able to find 
the password with a straightforward dictionary attack, 
and this vulnerability is independent of the strength of the operations, 
there is no requirement at this level to use Approved cryptographic techniques.

At Level 1, long-term shared authentication secrets may be revealed to verifiers.

8.2.1.1.Credential Lifetime, Status or Revocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no stipulations [#]_  about the revocation or lifetime of credentials at Level 1.

.. [#] To lay down as a condition of an agreement; require by contract. `FreeDictionary <http://www.thefreedictionary.com/stipulations>`_ . 

8.2.1.2.Assertions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relying parties may accept assertions that are: 

- digitally signed by a trusted entity (e.g., the verifier); or 
- obtained directly from a trusted entity (e.g. a repository or the verifier) using a

protocol where the trusted entity authenticates to the relying party using a secure protocol (e.g. TLS) 
that cryptographically authenticates the verifier and protects the assertion;


8.2.1.3.Protection of Long-Term Shared Secrets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Files of shared secrets used by verifiers at Level 1 authentication shall be protected by discretionary access controls 
that limit access to administrators and only those applications that require access. 
Such shared secret files shall not contain the plaintext passwords; 
typically they contain a one-way hash or “inversion” of the password. 
In addition, 
any method allowed for the protection of long-term shared secrets at Levels 2, 3 or 4 may be used at Level 1.

8.2.1.4.Password Strength
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For password (or PIN) based Level 1 authentication systems, 
the probability of success of a targeted on-line password guessing attack by an attacker 
who has no a priori knowledge of the password, 
but knows the user name of the target, shall not exceed 2-10 (1 in 1024), 
over the life of the password. 
There are no min-entropy requirements for Level 1. 
:ref:`Appendix A <nist-800-63.appendix.a>`  contains information about estimating the entropy of passwords.

8.2.1.5.Example Implementations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A wide variety of technologies should be able to meet the requirements of Level 1. 
For example, a verifier might obtain a subscriber password from a :term:`CSP` 
and authenticate the claimant by use of a challenge-response protocol.
