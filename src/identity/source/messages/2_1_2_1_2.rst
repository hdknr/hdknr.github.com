2.1.2.1.2.  "id_token" member
####################################

The structure and function of the "id_token" (:term:`ID Token request`) member 
of the :term:`OpenID Request Object` is similar to that of the "userinfo" member. 

It MAY include the OPTIONAL "claims" and "preferred_locales" members. 
The structure of these members is the same as that for the "userinfo" member. 
If the "claims" member is present in the "id_token" object, 
the :term:`Claims` requested within it modify the Claim set 
that would otherwise be returned in the ID Token.

Unlike for the "userinfo" member, typically these Claims will augment, rather than override the default set.

Following Claim MAY be requested in the ID Token by specifying it in the "claims" member:

.. glossary::

    auth_time
        OPTIONAL. 
        (authenticated at): 
        Requests that the "auth_time" Claim be present in the "id_token" response. The Claim Value in the request is null. 

In addition to the "claims" member, these additional members are defined within the "id_token" member of the OpenID Request Object:

.. glossary::

    max_age
        OPTIONAL. (max authentication age): Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if any present authentication is older than the specified number of seconds. (The "max_age" request parameter corresponds to the OpenID 2.0 openid.pape.max_auth_age request parameter.) 

    iso29115
        OPTIONAL. (entity authentication assurance): Specifies the X.1254 / ISO/IEC29115 [ISO29115] entity authentication assurance level that is requested by the Client. 

It is anticipated that 
additional "id_token" parameters MAY be defined to request 
that additional properties hold for the authentication - 
for instance, 
that certain authentication policies be applied 
(in the same spirit of the OpenID 2.0 **openid.pape.auth_policies** values), 
or that the authentication conform to the policies defined by a specified trust framework. 
These parameters MAY be defined by extension specifications.

All members of the "id_token" object are OPTIONAL. 
Other members MAY be present and if so, SHOULD be understood by both parties.
