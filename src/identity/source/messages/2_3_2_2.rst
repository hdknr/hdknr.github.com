2.3.2.2.  Claim Stability and Uniqueness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user_id claim is the only claim that a client can rely upon to be stable, 
since the user_id claim MUST be **locally unique** and **never reassigned within the Issuer** 
for a particular End-User, as described in :ref:`Section 2.1.1 <messages_2_1_1>`.

Therefore, 
the only guaranteed unique identifier for a given End-User is 
a combination of the :term:`Issuer`'s identifier and the user_id claim; 
other fields such as preferred_username and email MUST NOT be used as unique identifiers for a given End-User.

All other claims carry no such guarantees across different issuers 
in terms of stability over time or uniqueness across users, 
and Issuers are permitted to apply local restrictions and policies. 
For instance, 
an Issuer MAY re-use a given :term:`preferred_username` or email address claim 
across different End-Users at different points in time, 
and the claimed :term:`preferred_username` or email address for a given End-User MAY change over time.
