8.13.  Signing and Encryption order
------------------------------------------

Signatures over encrypted text are not considered valid in many jurisdictions. 
For the integrity of non-repudiation this specification requires signing of the plain text JSON.

It is however strongly RECOMMENDED that the selected Encryption algorithm include integrity to protect against padding oracle and other decryption attacks.

Implementation should consult the security consideration around the JWE [JWE] to avoid the vulnerability around these specifications.
