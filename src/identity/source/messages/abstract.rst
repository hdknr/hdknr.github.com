Abstract
=============

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the :term:`OAuth 2.0` protocol. 
It allows :term:`Clients` to verify the :term:`identity` of the :term:`End-User` 
based on the :term:`authentication` performed by an :term:`Authorization Server`, 
as well as to obtain basic profile information about the :term:`End-User` in an interoperable and :term:`RESTful manner`.

This specification only defines the :term:`endpoints` and the associated message formats. 
The actual use MUST be based on one of the companion protocol bindings specifications 
such as :doc:`OpenID Connect Standard <standard>`.
