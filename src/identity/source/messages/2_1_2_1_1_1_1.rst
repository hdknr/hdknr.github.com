2.1.2.1.1.1.1.  Requested Claims Member
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The members defined by this specification for the JSON object value following a Claim Name member are:

.. glossary::

    optional
        This is an OPTIONAL Claim parameter. 
        If present, 
        its value MUST be true, 
        which indicates that it is a OPTIONAL Claim. 
        If it is not present, it is a required Claim. 

Other members MAY be defined to provide additional information 
about the requested Claim. 

If the "claims" member is present in the "userinfo" object, 
the Claims requested 
within it override the Claim set that would otherwise be returned from the UserInfo Endpoint.
