3.4.  Check ID Endpoint
------------------------------

The Check ID endpoint validates ID Tokens and returns a JSON [RFC4627] object 
which contains information about the end user and authentication event associated with the supplied ID Token.

This endpoint can be used by clients that are not able to or do not wish to handle ID Tokens. 
In such cases, clients MAY treat the ID Token as an opaque value, 
and use the Check ID endpoint to retrieve and examine the claims associated with the token.

A full explanation of how to use an ID Token to perform session management can be found 
in the :doc:`OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 [OpenID.Session] <session>`.
