5.5.  UserInfo Response Verification
------------------------------------------------------

To verify the validity of the :term:`UserInfo response`, 
the :term:`Client` MUST do the following:

    1.  If the Client has provided a :term:`userinfo_encrypted_response_algs` parameter 
        during :term:`Registration`, 
        decrypt the :term:`id_token` [:term:`JWE`], 
        using the key pair specified during :term:`Registration`.

    2.  If the response was signed, 
        the Client SHOULD validate the signature according to :ref:`Section 5 of JWS <jws.5>` [:term:`JWS`].

    3.  Check that the OP that responded was really the intended OP 
        through a TLS/SSL server certificate check, per RFC 6125 [:term:`RFC6125`].
