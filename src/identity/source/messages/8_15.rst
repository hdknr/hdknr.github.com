8.15.  TLS Requirements
--------------------------------

Implementations MUST support TLS. 
Which version(s) ought to be implemented will vary over time, 
and depend on the widespread deployment 
and known security vulnerabilities at the time of implementation. 
At the time of this writing, 
TLS version 1.2 [:term:`RFC5246`] is the most recent version, 
but has very limited actual deployment, 
and might not be readily available in implementation toolkits. 
TLS version 1.0 [:term:`RFC2246`] is the most widely deployed version, 
and will give the broadest interoperability.

To protect against information disclosure and tampering, 
confidentiality protection MUST be applied using TLS with a ciphersuite that provides confidentiality and integrity protection.
