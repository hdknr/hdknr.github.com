------------------------------------------------

To verify the validity of the Token response, the client MUST do the following:

    1.  If the response is signed, the Client SHOULD validate the signature according to Section 5 of JWS [JWS].
    2.  Check that current time is within the validity period contained within the response.
    3.  Check that the OP that responded was really the intended OP through a TLS/SSL server certificate check.
