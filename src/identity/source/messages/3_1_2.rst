3.1.2.  Authorization Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Section 4.1.1 <oauth_4_1_1>` and :ref:`4.2.1 <oauth_4_1_2>` of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth.2.0] defines 
the OAuth Authorization Request parameters. In this specification, the values to the parameters are defined as follows.

.. glossary::

    response_type
        A space delimited, case sensitive list of string values. 
        Acceptable values include **code**, **token** and  **id_token**.
        The value MUST include 
        **code** for requesting an :term:`Authorization Code`, 
        **token** for requesting an :term:`Access Token`, 
        **id_token** for requesting an :term:`ID Token`.

    scope
        A space delimited, case sensitive list of string values. 
        The values specify an additive list of claims that are returned by the UserInfo endpoint. The following values are defined:

            openid
                REQUIRED. 
                Informs the Authorization Server that the client is making an OpenID request. 
                If the **openid** scope is not specified, 
                the server SHOULD treat the request as a generic OAuth 2.0 request, 
                and perform no **OpenID Connect processing**.  [#]_
                The **openid** value also requests that the ID Token associated with the authentication session be returned. 
                If the **response_type** includes **token**, the ID Token is returned in the Authorization Response along with the Access Token. 
                If the **response_type** includes **code**, the ID Token is returned as part of the Token endpoint response. 

            profile
                OPTIONAL. 
                This requests that access to the user's :ref:`profile claims <messages_table1>`  excluding the address 
                and email claims at the UserInfo endpoint be granted by the issued Access Token. 

            address
                OPTIONAL. This requests that access to the address claim at the UserInfo endpoint be granted by the issued Access Token. 

            email
                OPTIONAL. This requests that access to the email claim at the UserInfo endpoint be granted by the issued Access Token. 

Other required OAuth 2.0 parameters in the request include:

.. glossary::

    client_id
        The client identifier. 

    redirect_uri
        A redirection URI where the response will be sent. 

The following extension parameters are also defined:

.. glossary::

    nonce
        REQUIRED. A random, unique string value used to mitigate the replay attack. 

    display
        OPTIONAL. 
        A string value that specifies how the authorization server displays the authentication page to the user. [#]_

            **none**
                The authorization server MUST NOT display any authentication or confirmation user interface pages. 
                An error is returned if either the user is not already authenticated 
                or the client does not have pre-configured approval for the requested **scopes**. 
                This can be used as a method to check for existing authentication and/or approval. [#]_

    prompt
        OPTIONAL. 
        A space delimited, case sensitive list of string values that specifies 
        how the authorization server prompts the user for reauthentication and reapproval. The possible values are:

            login
                The authorization server MUST prompt the user for reauthentication. 

            consent
                The authorization server MUST prompt the user for reapproval before returning information to the client. 

            select_account
                The authorization server MUST prompt the user to select a user account 
                if the account has multiple accounts associated with it [#]_

        This can be used by the client to make sure that the user is still present for the current session 
        or to bring attention to the request. 
        If this parameter is used in conjunction with the **display** parameter set to "**none**", an error is returned. 

    audience
        OPTIONAL. The target audience identifier for the ID Token. 

    request
        OPTIONAL. A JWT [JWT] encoded OpenID Request Object. 

    request_uri
        OPTIONAL. 
        An URL that points to an OpenID Request Object. 
        This is used to pass an OpenID Request Object by reference.  [#]_
