5.7.  Code Verification
----------------------------------------

To verify the validity of a code issued with an ID Token in the implicit flow, 
the client SHOULD do the following:

Hash the code with the SHA hash algorithm of the same length 
as the hash used in the :term:`alg` paramater of the JWS header of the ID Token.

Take the left-most half of the hash and base64url encode it.
The value of :term:`c_hash` in the ID Token 
MUST match the value produced in step 3 above if :term:`c_hash` is present in the ID Token.
