2.3.2.1.  Address Claim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The components of a physical mailing address. 
Implementations MAY return only a subset of the fields of an address, 
depending upon the information available and the End-User's privacy preferences. 

For example, 
the country and region might be returned 
without returning more fine-grained address information.

Implementations MAY return just the full address as a single string in the formatted sub-field, 
or they MAY return just the individual component fields using the other sub-fields, 
or they MAY return both. 
If both variants are returned, 
they SHOULD be describing the same address, 
with the formatted address indicating how the component fields should be combined.
