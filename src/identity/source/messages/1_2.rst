    Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID)
        An identifier that identifies the Entity to a Relying Party.

        host, and OPTIONALLY, port number components. (No path component may be present.) 

    Message
        A request or a response between an OpenID Relying Party and an OpenID Provider. 

    OpenID Provider (OP)
        A service capable of providing Claims to a Relying Party. 

    OP Endpoints
        Authorization Endpoint, Token Endpoint, and UserInfo Endpoint. 

    OpenID Request Object
        A JSON object that holds the OpenID request parameters. 

    Relying Party (RP)
        An application requiring Claims from an OpenID Provider. 

    Check ID Endpoint
        A resource that, when presented with an ID Token by the Client, 
        returns Claims about the user session represented by that ID Token. 

    UserInfo Endpoint
        A Protected Resource that, when presented with an Access Token by the Client, 
        returns Claims about the End-User represented by that Access Token.
