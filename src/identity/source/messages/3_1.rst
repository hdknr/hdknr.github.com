3.1.  JSON Serialization
------------------------------------------

The parameters are serialized into a JSON structure by adding each parameter at the highest structure level. 
Parameter names and string values are included as JSON strings. 
Numerical values are included as JSON numbers. 
Each parameter MAY have JSON Structure as its value.

Following is a non-normative example of such serialization:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
     "access_token":"SlAV32hkKG",
     "expires_in":3600,
     "refresh_token":"8xLOxBtZp8"
    }
