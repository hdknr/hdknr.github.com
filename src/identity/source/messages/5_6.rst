5.6.  Access Token Verification
------------------------------------------------

To verify the validity of an Access Token issued with an ID Token in the implicit flow, 
the client SHOULD do the following:

Hash the :term:`access_token` with the SHA hash algorithm of the same length 
as the hash used in the :term:`alg` paramater of the JWS header of the ID Token.

Take the left-most half of the hash and base64url encode it.
The value of :term:`at_hash` in the ID Token MUST match the value produced in step 3 above if at_hash is present in the ID Token.
