6.  String Operations
================================

Processing some OpenID Connect messages requires comparing values 
in the messages to known values. 
For example, 
the Claim Names returned by the :term:`UserInfo Endpoint` might be compared to specific Claim Names 
such as :term:`user_id`. 
Comparing Unicode strings, however, has significant **security implications**.

Therefore, comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings MUST be performed as specified below:

    1.  Remove any JSON applied escaping to produce an array of Unicode code points.
    2.  Unicode Normalization [:term:`USA15`] MUST NOT be applied at any point 
        to either the JSON string or to the string it is to be compared against.
    3.  Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed 
        as a Unicode code point to code point equality comparison.

In several places, 
this specification uses space delimited lists of strings. 
In all such cases, 
only the ASCII space character (0x20) MAY be used for this purpose.
