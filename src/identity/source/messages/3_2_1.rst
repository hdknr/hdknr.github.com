3.2.1.  Access Token Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The client obtains an access token by authenticating with the authorization server 
and presenting its **access grant**
(in the form of 
an authorization code, 
resource owner credentials, 
an assertion, or 
a refresh token).

Clients required to authenticate with the authorization server 
MUST do so according to section :ref:`3.2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth.2.0] <oauth_3_2_1>`. 
OAuth defines an alternative method for clients to authenticate with symmetric client keys 
through the use of the **client_id** and **client_secret** parameter in the message request body. 

This specification extends the client authentication scheme 
to allow clients to authenticate with **asymmetric keys**. 
Asymmetric client authentication allows the client to authenticate 
with the authorization server **without sending its secret key**. 
The asymmetric client authentication parameters are the following:

.. glossary::

    client_id
        REQUIRED. 
        The client identifier of the client. 

    secret_type
        OPTIONAL. 
        Specifies the client authentication type which determines 
        how the client_secret parameter is interpreted. 
        It can be one of "basic" or "JWT". 
        The defaults value is "basic". 
        If the value is "basic", 
        the client is performing symmetric key authentication as specified in OAuth 2.0. 
        If the value is "JWT", the client is performing asymmetric key authentication. 

    client_secret
        REQUIRED. 
        The client secret. 
        If the secret_type is "basic", 
        the value is the pre-shared secret that was issued to the client during client registration. 
        If the "secret_type" is "JWT", 
        the value is the JWS [JWS] signature of a JSON object containing one of the following claims: [#]_

            code
                REQUIRED. 
                The authorization code that was issued by the authorization server. 

            refresh_token
                REQUIRED. 
                The refresh token that was issued.

In addition to the client authentication parameters, 
the client MUST send the request parameter for the Access Token endpoint 
as specified in section :ref:`4.1.3 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth.2.0] <oauth_4_1_3>`.
