6.8.  Check ID Response Verification
---------------------------------------------

To verify the validity of the Response, the client MUST do the following:

    1.  Check that current time is within the validity period of the exp contained within the response.
    2.  Verify that the response was intended for the recipient, using the aud (audience) contained within the response. [#]_
    3.  Verify that iss is a trusted issuer of the response. [#]_
    4.  If nonce is present, verify that it is the same value as the one that was sent in the authorization request. [#]_
    5.  Check that the server that responded was really the intended server through a TLS/SSL server certificate check.

.. [#] `Issue 201 <https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issue/201>`  Exact validation rules?
.. [#] `Issue 202 <https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issue/202>`
.. [#] `Issue 203 <https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issue/203>`_ nonces must also be checked against replay/reuse (otherwise it shouldn't be called nonce here).
