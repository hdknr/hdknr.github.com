4.1.  Supported Algorithms
---------------------------------------

The :term:`server` advertises its supported signing and encryption algorithms in its discovery document. The related elements are:

.. glossary::

    userinfo_algs_supported
        A JSON array containing a list of the JWS [JWS] and JWE [JWE] 
        signing and encryption algorithms supported by the UserInfo Endpoint. 

    id_token_algs_supported
        A JSON array containing a list of the JWS [JWS] and JWE [JWE] 
        signing and encryption algorithms supported by the :term:`Authorization Server` for the :term:`ID Token`. 

    request_object_algs_supported
        A JSON array containing a list of the JWS [JWS] and JWE [JWE] 
        signing and encryption algorithms supported by the :term:`Authorization Server` for the :term:`OpenID Request Object`. 
        Servers SHOULD support :term:`HS256`. 

    token_endpoint_auth_algs_supported
        A JSON array containing a list of the JWS [JWS] 
        signing algorithms supported by the :term:`Token Endpoint` for the :term:`private_key_jwt` method. 
        Servers SHOULD support :term:`RS256`. 

The :term:`Client` registers its required algorithms for Signing and Encryption using the following Registration parameters:

.. glossary::

    require_signed_request_object
        OPTIONAL. 
        The JWS [JWS] signature algorithm that MUST be required by the :term:`Authorization Server`. 
        All OpenID Request Objects from this :term:`client_id` MUST be rejected if not signed by this algorithm. 

    userinfo_signed_response_algs
        OPTIONAL. 
        The JWS [JWS] signature algorithm required for userinfo responses. 
        If this is specified the response will be JWT [JWT] serialized. 

    userinfo_encrypted_response_algs
        OPTIONAL. 
        A space separated list of the JWE [JWE] alg and enc algorithms required for userinfo responses. 
        If this is requested in combination with signing the response MUST signed first then encrypted. 
        If this is specified the response will be JWT [JWT] serialized. 

    id_token_signed_response_algs
        OPTIONAL. 
        The JWS [JWS] signing algorithm required for :term:`id_token` issued to this :term:`client_id`. 
        The default if not specified is HS256 using the provided client_secret as the shared key. 

    id_token_encrypted_response_algs
        OPTIONAL. 
        A space separated list of the JWE [JWE] alg and enc algorithms required for :term`id_token` issued to this :term:`client_id`. 
        If this is requested the response MUST be signed then encrypted. 
        The default if not specified is no encryption.
