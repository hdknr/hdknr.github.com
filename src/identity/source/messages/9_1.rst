9.1.  Refresh Token, and Access Token Lifetime
----------------------------------------------------------------

:term:`Access Token grants` are not revocable by the :term:`Authorization Server`. 
:term:`Access Token grant lifetimes` SHOULD be kept to **single use** or **very short lifetimes**.

If access to the :term:`User Info Endpoint` or other protected resources is required, 
a :term:`Refresh Token` should be used. 
The :term:`Client` may then exchange the :term:`Refresh Token` at the :term:`Token Endpoint` 
for a fresh short lived :term:`Access Token`, 
that can be used to access the resource.

.. note::
    If the Client accesses the User Info Endpoint or other portected resource sometime later 
    after the grant lifetime is over, ..... 

The :term:`Authorization Server` SHOULD clearly identify long term grants to the :term:`User` during :term:`Authorization`. [#]_

.. [#] Difficult to grasp.

The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST provide a mechanisim for the user to revoke :term:`Refresh Tokens` granted to a client.
