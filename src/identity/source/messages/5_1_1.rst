5.1.1.  Encrypted Request Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the :term:`Authorization Server` has advertised :term:`JWE` encryption algorithms 
in the :term:`request_object_algs_supported` element of its :term:`Discovery Document`, 
these are used by the Client to JWE encrypt the JWT.

The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST decode the :term:`JWT` 
in accordance with JSON Web Encryption [:term:`JWE`] specification. 
The result MAY be either :term:`OpenID Request Object` or a :term:`JWS Signed JWT`. 
In the latter case, 
the signature verification MUST be performed as defined in :term:`Signed Request Object`.

The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST return the error if there is a decryption error. 


.. note::

    Decription error should be JWE decription error. Look at :doc:`JWE` error.
