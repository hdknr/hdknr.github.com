4.3.  Signing
----------------------------

The signing party MUST select a :term:`signature algorithm` 
based on the supported algorithms of the recipient in :ref:`Section 4.1 <messages_4_1>`.

.. glossary::

    Symmetric Signatures
        When using :term:`HMAC Signatures`, 
        the :term:`alg` Claim of the :term:`JWS header` MUST be set to the appropriate algorithm 
        as defined in JSON Web Signature [:term:`JWS`]. 
        The :term:`client_secret` MUST be used as the signature key. 

    Asymmetric Signatures
        When using :term:`RSA` or :term:`ECDSA Signatures`, 
        the :term:`alg` Claim of the :term:`JWS header` MUST be set to the appropriate algorithm 
        as defined in JSON Web Signature [:term:`JWS`]. 

        The private key MUST be the one associated with the :term:`Public Signing Key` 
        provided in :ref:`Section 4.2 <messages_4_2>`. 

        If there are multiple keys in the referenced :doc:`JWK document<jwk>` , 
        the :term:`kid` MUST be specified in the :term:`JWS header`. 

        If there are multiple certificates at the referenced certificate location, 
        then :term:`x5t` MUST be specified in the :term:`JWS header`. 
        The key usage of the respective keys MUST include signature. 
        In particular, 
        if the key found through :term:`x5u` is used, 
        the key usage MUST include :term:`digitalSignature`. 

.. note::
    Key Usage ":term:`digitalSignature`" should be described with more words.
