5.3.  Check ID Request Verification
------------------------------------------------------

The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST check 
that the :term:`access_token` is present in the request and if it is signed, 
it MUST verify the signature according to :ref:`Section 5 of JWS <jws.5>` [:term:`JWS`].

If the JWS algorithm is symmetric, 
such as the default :term:`HS256` for :term:`id_token`, 
the :term:`client_secret` for the :term:`client_id` 
contained in the :term:`aud` (audience) Claim MUST be used to validate the signature.

The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST check that the :term:`id_token` 
provided as the :term:`access_token` contains all REQUIRED Claims.
