2.3.2.  UserInfo Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The UserInfo Claims MUST be returned as the members of a JSON object 
unless a signed or encrypted response was requested during Client Registration. 

The Claims defined in :ref:`Section 2.5 <messages.2.5>` can be returned, 
as can additional Claims not specified there.

If a Claim is not returned, 
that Claim Name SHOULD be omitted from the JSON object representing the Claims; 
it SHOULD NOT be present with a null or empty string value.

The sub (subject) Claim MUST always be returned in the UserInfo Response.

NOTE: 
The UserInfo Endpoint response is not guaranteed to be about the End-User identified 
by the sub (subject) element of the ID Token. 
The sub Claim in the UserInfo Endpoint response MUST be verified 
to exactly match the sub Claim in the ID Token 
before using additional UserInfo Endpoint Claims.
