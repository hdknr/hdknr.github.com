2.1.4.  Authorization Error Response

If the End-User denies the access request or if the request fails, the Authorization Server informs the Client by returning parameters defined in sections 4.1.2.1 and 4.2.2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0].

In addition to the error codes defined in section 4.1.2.1 and 4.2.2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0], this specification defines the following error codes:

    invalid_request_redirect_uri
        The redirect_uri in the Authorization Request does not match any of the Client's pre-registered redirect_uris. 
    login_required
        The Authorization Server requires End-User authentication. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter in the Authorization Request is set to "none" to request that the Authorization Server should not display any user interfaces to the End-User, but the Authorization Request cannot be completed without displaying a user interface for user authentication. 
    session_selection_required
        The End-User is required to select a session at the Authorization Server. The End-User MAY be authenticated at the Authorization Server with different associated accounts, but the End-User did not select a session. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter in the Authorization Request is set to "none" to request that the Authorization Server should not display any user interfaces to the End-User, but the Authorization Request cannot be completed without displaying a user interface to prompt for a session to use. 
    consent_required
        The Authorization Server requires End-User consent. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter in the Authorization Request is set to "none" to request that the Authorization Server should not display any user interfaces to the End-User, but the Authorization Request cannot be completed without displaying a user interface for End-User consent. 
    user_mismatched
        The current logged in End-User at the Authorization Server does not match the requested user. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter in the Authorization Request is set to "none" to request that the Authorization Server should not display any user interfaces to the End-User, but the Authorization Request cannot be completed without displaying a user interface to prompt for the correct End-User authentication. 
    invalid_request_uri
        The request_uri in the Authorization Request returns an error or invalid data. 
    invalid_openid_request_object
        The request parameter contains an invalid openid_request_object. 

Errors are returned as defined by the registered OAuth 2.0 response_type.
