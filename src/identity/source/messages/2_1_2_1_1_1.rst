2.1.2.1.1.1.  "claims" member
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

The "claims" member is a JSON object with a member for each requested Claim. 
The member names are the requested Claim names. 
The member values MAY be either:

.. glossary::
   
    null
        This indicates that this Claim is being requested in the default manner. 
        In particular, this is a required Claim. 

    A JSON Object
        This is used to provide additional information about the Claim being requested. 

The Claims MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts. 
To specify languages and scripts for the claim request, BCP47 [:term:`RFC5646`] language tags 
delimited by a "#" MUST be added to each requested Claim Name for which a particular language 
and script is requested. 
For example, 
the Claim **family_name#ja-Kana-JP** is used for expressing **Family Name** in Katakana in Japanese, 
which is commonly used to index and represent the phonetics of the Kanji representation 
of the same value represented as family_name#ja-Hani-JP.

All members of the "claims" object are OPTIONAL.
