8.1.  Assertion Manufacture/Modification
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To mitigate this attack, there are two ways to mitigate it.

    -   The assertion may be digitally signed by the OP. 
        The Relying Party SHOULD check the digital signature to verify that it was issued by a legitimate OP.

    -   The assertion may be sent over a protected channel such as TLS/SSL. 
        In order to protect the integrity of assertions from malicious attack, the OP MUST be authenticated. 
        In this specification, the assertion is always sent over TLS/SSL protected channel.
