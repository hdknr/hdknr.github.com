8.7.  Secondary Authenticator Capture
---------------------------------------------------

Secondary authenticator (="**code**") is transmitted only through HTTPS, 
thus it is protected between the OP and the User-Agent, and User-Agent and the RP.

Only the place it can be captured is the User-Agent where the TLS session is terminated, 
and is possible if the User-Agent is infested by malwares. 
However, it renders no usefulness as long as the profile in use either RP authentication or assertion encryption.
