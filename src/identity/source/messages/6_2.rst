6.2.  Authorization Response Verification
------------------------------------------------------

To verify the validity of the Authorization Response, the client MUST to the following:

    1.  If the response was signed, the Client SHOULD verify the token signature as the first step.
    2.  Check that current time is within the validity period contained within the response.
    3.  Check that the OP that responded was really the intended OP through a TLS/SSL server certificate check.

If the client does not directly verify the signature, it MUST make a request to the :term:`Check ID Endpoint` to validate the token.
