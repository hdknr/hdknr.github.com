7.4. Self-Issued OpenID Provider Response
------------------------------------------------

The Self-Issued OpenID Provider response is the same 
as the normal :term:`implicit flow` response 
with the following refinements. 
Since it is an implicit flow response, 
the response parameters will be returned in a **fragment**.

1.  The iss (issuer) Claim Value is https://self-issued.me.

2.  A sub_jwk Claim is present, with its value being the public key value 
    used to check the signature of the ID Token.

3.  The sub (subject) Claim value is the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash 
    of the concatenation of the bytes of the UTF-8 representations 
    of the base64url encoded key values in the sub_jwk Claim. 

   When the kty value is RSA, 
   the key values n and e are concatenated in that order. 
    When the kty value is EC, 
    the key values crv, x, and y are concatenated in that order.

4.  No Access Token is returned for accessing a UserInfo Endpoint, 
    so all Claims returned must be in the ID Token.
