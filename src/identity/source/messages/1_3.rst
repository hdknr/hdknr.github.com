1.3.  Overview
---------------------------

The OpenID Connect protocol, in abstract, follows the following steps.

    1. The :term:`Client` sends a request to the :term:`Authorization Server`'s :term:`End-User` :term:`Authorization Endpoint`.
    2. The :term:`Authorization Server` authenticates the :term:`End-User` and obtains appropriate authorization.
    3. The :term:`Authorization Server` responds with an :term:`Access Token`, an :term:`Id Token`, and a few other variables.
    4. The :term:`Client` sends a request with the :term:`Access Token` to the :term:`UserInfo Endpoint`.
    5. :term:`UserInfo Endpoint` returns the additional :term:`End-User` information supported by the :term:`Resource Server`.
    6. Optionally, the :term:`Client` sends a request with the :term:`ID Token` to the :term:`Authorization Server`'s :term:`Check ID Endpoint`.
    7. Optionally, the :term:`Check ID Endpoint` responds with authentication information pertaining to the supplied :term:`ID Token`.

This specification only defines the abstract message flow and message formats. 
The actual use MUST be based on one of the companion protocol bindings specifications 
such as OpenID Connect Basic Client [:term:`OpenID.Basic`] or OpenID Connect Standard [:term:`OpenID.Standard`].
