8.2.  Assertion Disclosure
----------------------------------------

The Assertion disclosure can be mitigated in the following two ways.

    -   Assertion is sent over TLS/SSL protected channel, where RP is authenticated by "**client_id**" and "**client_secret**".

    -   Signed Assertion is encrypted by the RP's public key.
