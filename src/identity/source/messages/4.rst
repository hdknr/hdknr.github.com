4.  Signatures and Encryption
====================================

Depending on the transport through which the messages are sent, 
the integrity of the message may not be guaranteed and 
the originator of the message may not be authenticated. 
To mitigate these risks, 
OpenID Connect messages MAY utilize JSON Web Signature (JWS) [:term:`JWS`] to sign the content.

To achieve message confidentiality, 
OpenID Connect messages MAY use JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [:term:`JWE`] to encrypt the content.

When the message is both signed and encrypted, 
it MUST be signed first then encrypted. The 
value of the typ parameter in the enclosing JWT header MUST be "JWS"
