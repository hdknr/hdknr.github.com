2.10.1.  "request_uri" Rationale
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    論理的根拠。基本原則。
    
    - request パラメータのデータがでかすぎる

There are several reasons that one might choose to use the request_uri parameter:

The set of request parameters can become large, 
and may exceed browser URI size limitations. 
Passing the request parameters by reference can solve this problem.
Passing a request_uri value, rather than a complete request by value, may reduce request latency.
Most requests for Claims from an RP are constant. 
The request_uri is a way of creating and sometimes also signing and encrypting a constant set of request parameters in advance. 
(The request_uri value becomes an "artifact" representing a particular fixed set of request parameters.)
Pre-registering a fixed set of request parameters at registration time enables OPs to cache and pre-validate the request parameters at registration time, meaning they need not be retrieved at request time.
