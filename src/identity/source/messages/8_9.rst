8.9.  Authentication Request Disclosure
------------------------------------------------

If the authentication request is POSTed directly through a protected channel, 
it is not possible to disclose the authentication request.

If the Request File is encrypted by the OP's public key, 
the authentication request will not be disclosed 
unless OP's private key gets compromised or the encryption algorithm becomes vulnerable.
