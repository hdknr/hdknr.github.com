3.1.2.1.2.  "id_token" member
#######################################################

The structure and function of the "id_token" (ID Token request) member of the OpenID Request object 
is similar to that of the "userinfo" member. 
It MAY include "claims", "format", "locale". 
The same structure of these members are the same as that for the "userinfo" member. 
If the "claims" member is present in the "id_token" object, 
the claims requested within it modify the default claim set that would otherwise be returned in the ID Token. 
Unlike for the "userinfo" member, typically these claims will **augment, rather than override the default set**.

Following claim MAY be requested in the ID Token by specifying it in the "claims" member:

.. glossary::

    auth_time
        OPTIONAL. 
        (authenticated at): 
        Requests that the "auth_time" claim be present. 
        The claim value is the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC 
        until the date/time that the user authentication occurred. 
        (The "auth_time" claim semantically corresponds to the openid.pape.auth_time response parameter.) 

.. note::
   `Issue 194 <https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issue/194>`_

In addition to the "claims" member, this additional member is defined within the "id_token" member of the OpenID Request object:

.. glossary::

    max_age
        OPTIONAL. 
        (max authentication age): 
        Specifies that the user must be actively authenticated if any present authentication is older than 
        the specified number of seconds. 
        (The "max_age" request parameter corresponds to the OpenID 2.0 openid.pape.max_auth_age request parameter.) 

    iso29115
        OPTIONAL. 
        (entity authentication assurance): 
        Specifies the X.eaa / ISO/IEC29115 [ISO29115] entity authentication assurance level that is requested by the client. 

It is anticipated that additional "id_token" parameters MAY be defined to request that additional properties hold for the authentication 
- for instance, that certain authentication policies be applied (in the same spirit of the OpenID 2.0 openid.pape.auth_policies values), 
or that the authentication conform to the policies defined by a specified trust framework. 
These parameters MAY be defined by extension specifications.

All members of the "id_token" object are OPTIONAL. 
Other members MAY be present and if so, SHOULD understood by both parties
