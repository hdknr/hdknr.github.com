==================

In OpenID Connect protocols, in abstract, 
the process proceeds by the RP interacting with endpoints. 
There are a number of endpoints involved.

    1. Authorization Endpoint: 

       The RP sends a request to the OP at the Authorization Endpoint. 
       The OP then authenticates the End-User to find out 
       if he is eligible to make the authorization. 

       Then, upon the authorization action of the End-User, 
       the Authorization Server returns an Authorization Response 
       that includes Authorization Code, code. 

       For some Clients, 
       Implicit Grant may be used to obtain access_token without using code. 
       In this case, response_type MUST include token. 
       When id_token was specified in the response_type, 
       then the id_token is returned from this endpoint as well.

    2. Token Endpoint: 

       The Client sends the Access Token Request to the Token Endpoint 
       to obtain an Access Token Response which includes an access_token.

    3. UserInfo Endpoint: 

       The access_token MAY be sent to the UserInfo Endpoint 
       to obtain Claims about the End-User.
