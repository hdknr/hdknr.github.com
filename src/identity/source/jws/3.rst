3.  JSON Web Signature (JWS) Overview
===================================================

JWS represents signed content using JSON data structures and base64url encoding. The representation consists of three parts: the JWS Header, the JWS Payload, and the JWS Signature. The three parts are base64url-encoded for transmission, and typically represented as the concatenation of the encoded strings in that order, with the three strings being separated by period ('.') characters, as is done when used in JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [JWT].

A base64url encoded JSON object - the JWS Header - describes the signature method used. A portion of the base64url encoded content that is signed is the Encoded JWS Payload. Finally, JWSs contain a signature that ensures the integrity of the contents of the JWS Header and the JWS Payload. This signature value is base64url encoded to produce the Encoded JWS Signature.

The member names within the JWS Header are referred to as Header Parameter Names. These names MUST be unique. The corresponding values are referred to as Header Parameter Values. The JWS Header MUST contain an alg parameter, the value of which is a string that unambiguously identifies the algorithm used to sign the JWS Header and the JWS Payload to produce the JWS Signature.
