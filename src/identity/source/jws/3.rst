3. JSON Web Signature (JWS) Overview
========================================================

JWS represents digitally signed or MACed content using JSON data
structures and base64url encoding.  The representation consists of
three parts: the JWS Header, the JWS Payload, and the JWS Signature.
In the Compact Serialization, the three parts are base64url-encoded
for transmission, and represented as the concatenation of the encoded
strings in that order, with the three strings being separated by two
period ('.') characters.  (A JSON Serialization for this information
is defined in the separate JSON Web Signature JSON Serialization
(JWS-JS) :term:`[JWS-JS]` specification.)

The JWS Header describes the signature or MAC method and parameters
employed.  The JWS Payload is the message content to be secured.  The
JWS Signature ensures the integrity of both the JWS Header and the
JWS Payload.
