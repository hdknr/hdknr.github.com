5.3.  String Comparison Rules
--------------------------------------------

Processing a JWS inevitably requires comparing known strings 
to members and values in a JSON object.  

For example, 
in checking what the algorithm is, 
the Unicode string "alg" will be checked against the member names 
in the JWS Header to see 
if there is a matching Header Parameter name.  

The same process is then used to determine 
if the value of the "alg" Header Parameter represents 
a supported algorithm.


Since the only string comparison operations that are performed 
are equality and inequality, 
the same rules can be used for comparing 
both member names and member values against known strings.  

The JSON rules for doing member name comparison 
are described in Section 8.3 of [RFC7159].

Also, 
see the JSON security considerations in :ref:`Section 10 <jws.10>`.
2 and the Unicode security considerations in :ref:`Section 10.3 <jws.10.3>`.
