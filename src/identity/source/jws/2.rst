   JSON Web Signature (JWS)  
      A data structure cryptographically securing
      a JWS Header and a JWS Payload with a JWS Signature value.

   JWS Header  
      A string representing a JSON object that describes the
      digital signature or MAC operation applied to create the JWS
      Signature value.

   JWS Payload  
      The bytes to be secured -- a.k.a., the message.  The
      payload can contain an arbitrary sequence of bytes.

   JWS Signature  
      A byte array containing the cryptographic material
      that secures the JWS Header and the JWS Payload.

   Base64url Encoding  
      The URL- and filename-safe Base64 encoding
      described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648], Section 5, with the (non URL-
      safe) '=' padding characters omitted, as permitted by Section 3.2.
      (See Appendix C for notes on implementing base64url encoding
      without padding.)

   Encoded JWS Header  
      Base64url encoding of the bytes of the UTF-8
      [RFC3629] representation of the JWS Header.

   Encoded JWS Payload  
      Base64url encoding of the JWS Payload.

   Encoded JWS Signature  
      Base64url encoding of the JWS Signature.

   JWS Secured Input  
      The concatenation of the Encoded JWS Header, a
      period ('.') character, and the Encoded JWS Payload.

   Header Parameter Name  
      The name of a member of the JSON object
      representing a JWS Header.

   Header Parameter Value  
      The value of a member of the JSON object
      representing a JWS Header.

   JWS Compact Serialization  
      A representation of the JWS as the
      concatenation of the Encoded JWS Header, the Encoded JWS Payload,
      and the Encoded JWS Signature in that order, with the three
      strings being separated by two period ('.') characters.

   Collision Resistant Namespace  
      A namespace that allows names to be
      allocated in a manner such that they are highly unlikely to
      collide with other names.  For instance, collision resistance can
      be achieved through administrative delegation of portions of the
      namespace or through use of collision-resistant name allocation
      functions.  Examples of Collision Resistant Namespaces include:
      Domain Names, Object Identifiers (OIDs) as defined in the ITU-T
      X.660 and X.670 Recommendation series, and Universally Unique
      IDentifiers (UUIDs) [RFC4122].  When using an administratively
      delegated namespace, the definer of a name needs to take
      reasonable precautions to ensure they are in control of the
      portion of the namespace they use to define the name.

   StringOrURI  
      A JSON string value, with the additional requirement
      that while arbitrary string values MAY be used, any value
      containing a ":" character MUST be a URI [RFC3986].  StringOrURI
      values are compared as case-sensitive strings with no
      transformations or canonicalizations applied.
