2.  Terminology
=====================

.. glossary::

   JSON Web Signature (JWS)  
        A data structure cryptographically securing
        a :term:`JWS Header` and a :term:`JWS Payload` with a :term:`JWS Signature` value.

   JWS Header  
        A string representing a JSON object that describes the
        :term:`digital signature` or :term:`MAC` operation applied 
        to create the :term:`JWS Signature` value.

   JWS Payload  
        The bytes to be secured - a.k.a., the message.  
        The payload can contain an arbitrary sequence of bytes.

   JWS Signature  
        A byte array containing the cryptographic material
        that secures the contents of the :term:`JWS Header` and the :term:`JWS Payload`.

   Encoded JWS Header  
        :term:`Base64url` encoding of the bytes of the UTF-8 
        RFC 3629 [RFC3629] representation of the :term:`JWS Header`.

   Encoded JWS Payload  
        :term:`Base64url` encoding of the :term:`JWS Payload`.

   Encoded JWS Signature  
        :term:`Base64url` encoding of the :term:`JWS Signature`.

   JWS Secured Input  
        The concatenation of the :term:`Encoded JWS Header`, a period ('.') character, 
        and the :term:`Encoded JWS Payload`.

   Header Parameter Names  
        The names of the members within the JSON object represented in a :term:`JWS Header`.

   Header Parameter Values  
        The values of the members within the JSON object 
        represented in a :term:`JWS Header`.

   JWS Compact Serialization  
        A representation of the JWS as the concatenation of the :term:`Encoded JWS Header`, 
        the :term:`Encoded JWS Payload`, and the :term:`Encoded JWS Signature` in that order, 
        with the three strings being separated by period ('.') characters.

   StringOrURI  
        A JSON string value, with the additional requirement
        that while arbitrary string values MAY be used, 
        any value containing a ":" character MUST be a URI as defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].
