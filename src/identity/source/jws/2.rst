   JSON Web Signature (JWS)  
        A data structure representing 
        a digitally signed or MACed message.

   JWS Header  
        JSON object containing the parameters 
        describing the cryptographic operations 
        and parameters employed.  

        The JWS Header members are the union of the members 
        of the JWS Protected Header
        and the JWS Unprotected Header.  

        The members of the JWS Header are Header Parameters.

   JWS Payload  
        The sequence of octets to be secured -- a.k.a., 
        the message.  

        The payload can contain an arbitrary sequence of octets.

   JWS Signature  
      Digital signature or MAC over the JWS Protected Header
      and the JWS Payload.

   Header Parameter  
      A name/value pair that is member of the JWS Header.

   JWS Protected Header  
        JSON object that contains 
        the JWS Header Parameters that are integrity protected 
        by the JWS Signature digital signature or MAC operation.  

        For the JWS Compact Serialization, 
        this comprises the entire JWS Header.  

        For the JWS JSON Serialization, 
        this is one component of the JWS Header.

   JWS Unprotected Header  
        JSON object that contains 
        the JWS Header Parameters that are not integrity protected.  

        This can only be present 
        when using the JWS JSON Serialization.

   Base64url Encoding  
        Base64 encoding 
        using the URL- and filename-safe character set 
        defined in Section 5 of RFC 4648 [RFC4648], 
        with all trailing '=' characters omitted 
        (as permitted by Section 3.2).  

        (See Appendix C for notes on implementing base64url encoding
        without padding.)

   JWS Signing Input  
        The input to the digital signature or 
        MAC computation.  

        Its value is 
        ASCII(BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected Header)) || '.' || BASE64URL(JWS Payload)).

   JWS Compact Serialization  
        A representation of the JWS as a compact,
        URL-safe string.

   JWS JSON Serialization  
        A representation of the JWS as a JSON object.
     
        Unlike the JWS Compact Serialization, 
        the JWS JSON Serialization enables multiple digital signatures 
        and/or MACs to be applied to the same content.  

        This representation is neither optimized for
        compactness nor URL-safe.


   Collision-Resistant Name  
        A name in a namespace that enables names to
        be allocated in a manner such that 
        they are highly unlikely to collide with other names.  

        Examples of collision-resistant namespaces include: 
        Domain Names, 
        Object Identifiers (OIDs) as defined in the ITU-T X.660 and 
        X.670 Recommendation series, and
        Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUIDs) [RFC4122].  

        When using an administratively delegated namespace, 
        the definer of a name needs to take reasonable precautions 
        to ensure they are in control of the portion of the namespace 
        they use to define the name.

   StringOrURI  
        A JSON string value, 
        with the additional requirement that while arbitrary string values 
        MAY be used, 
        any value containing a ":" character MUST be a URI [RFC3986].  

        StringOrURI values are compared as case-sensitive strings 
        with no transformations or canonicalizations applied.
