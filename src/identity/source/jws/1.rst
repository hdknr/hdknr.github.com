1.  Introduction

JSON Web Signature (JWS) is a compact signature format intended for space constrained environments 
such as HTTP :term:`Authorization headers` and :term:`URI query parameters`. 
It represents signed content using JSON [RFC4627] data structures. 
The JWS signature mechanisms are independent of the type of content being signed, 
allowing arbitrary content to be signed. 

A related encryption capability is described in a separate JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] specification.

1. Introduction
====================================


JSON Web Signature (JWS) is a compact format for representing content
secured with digital signatures or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) 
intended for space constrained environments 
such as HTTP Authorization headers and URI query parameters.  

It represents this content using JSON [RFC4627] data structures.  
The JWS digital
   signature and MAC mechanisms are independent of the type of content
   being secured, allowing arbitrary content to be secured.
   Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers used with this specification
   are enumerated in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA]
   specification.  Related encryption capabilities are described in the
   separate JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] specification.
