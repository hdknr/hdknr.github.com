1.  Introduction
====================================

JSON Web Signature (JWS) is a compact signature format intended for space constrained environments 
such as HTTP :term:`Authorization headers` and :term:`URI query parameters`. 
It represents signed content using JSON [RFC4627] data structures. 
The JWS signature mechanisms are independent of the type of content being signed, 
allowing arbitrary content to be signed. 

A related encryption capability is described in a separate JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] specification.
