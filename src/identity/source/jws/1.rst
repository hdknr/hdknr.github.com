1. Introduction
==================================== 

JSON Web Signature (JWS) is 
a compact format for representing content
secured with digital signatures or 
Message Authentication Codes (MACs) 
intended for space constrained environments 
such as HTTP Authorization headers and URI query parameters.  
It represents this content 
using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] data structures.  
The JWS cryptographic mechanisms provide integrity protection 
for arbitrary sequences of bytes.

Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this specification 
are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification.  
Related encryption capabilities are described 
in the separate JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] specification.
