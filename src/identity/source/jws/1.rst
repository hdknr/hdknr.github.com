1. Introduction
==================================== 

   JSON Web Signature (JWS) represents content secured with digital
   signatures or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) using JavaScript
   Object Notation (JSON) [I-D.ietf-json-rfc4627bis] based data
   structures.  The JWS cryptographic mechanisms provide integrity
   protection for an arbitrary sequence of octets.

   Two closely related serializations for JWS objects are defined.  The
   JWS Compact Serialization is a compact, URL-safe representation
   intended for space constrained environments such as HTTP
   Authorization headers and URI query parameters.  The JWS JSON
   Serialization represents JWS objects as JSON objects and enables
   multiple signatures and/or MACs to be applied to the same content.
   Both share the same cryptographic underpinnings.

   Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this
   specification are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)
   [JWA] specification and an IANA registry defined by that
   specification.  Related encryption capabilities are described in the
   separate JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] specification.

   Names defined by this specification are short because a core goal is
   for the resulting representations to be compact.
