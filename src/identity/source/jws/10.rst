10.  Security Considerations
======================================================

All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
must be faced by a JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  Among these issues are
protecting the user's asymmetric private and symmetric secret keys,
preventing various attacks, and helping avoid mistakes such as
inadvertently encrypting a message to the wrong recipient.  The
entire list of security considerations is beyond the scope of this
document, but some significant concerns are listed here.

All the security considerations in XML DSIG 2.0
[W3C.NOTE-xmldsig-core2-20130411], also apply to this specification,
other than those that are XML specific.  Likewise, many of the best
practices documented in XML Signature Best Practices
[W3C.NOTE-xmldsig-bestpractices-20130411] also apply to this
specification, other than those that are XML specific.
