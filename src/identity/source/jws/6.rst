6.  Key Identification
==========================================

It is necessary for the recipient of a JWS 
to be able to determine the key that was employed 
for the digital signature or MAC operation.  

The key employed can be identified using the Header Parameter methods
described in :ref:`Section 4.1 <jws.4.1>` 
or can be identified using methods that are outside the scope of this specification.  

Specifically, 
the Header Parameters "jku", "jwk", "kid", "x5u", "x5c", "x5t", and "x5t#S256"
can be used to identify the key used.  These Header Parameters MUST
be integrity protected if the information that they convey is to be
utilized in a trust decision.


The sender SHOULD include sufficient information 
in the Header Parameters to identify the key used, 
unless the application uses another means or convention to determine the key used.  

Validation of the signature or MAC fails 
when the algorithm used requires a key 
(which is true of all algorithms except for "none") 
and the key used cannot be determined.

The means of exchanging any shared symmetric keys used is 
outside the scope of this specification.

Also, 
see :ref:`Appendix D <jws.appendix.d>` for notes on possible key selection algorithms.
