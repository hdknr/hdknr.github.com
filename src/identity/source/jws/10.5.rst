10.5.  SHA-1 Certificate Thumbprints
--------------------------------------------

A SHA-1 hash is used when computing "x5t" 
(X.509 Certificate SHA-1 Thumbprint) values, 
for compatibility reasons.  

Should an effective means of producing SHA-1 hash collisions be developed, 
and should an attacker wish to interfere with the use of a known certificate on a
given system, this could be accomplished by creating another
certificate whose SHA-1 hash value is the same and adding it to the
certificate store used by the intended victim.  A prerequisite to
this attack succeeding is the attacker having write access to the
intended victim's certificate store.

Header Parameter could be used instead of "x5t".  

However, at the time of this writing, 
no development platform is known 
to support SHA-256 certificate thumbprints.
