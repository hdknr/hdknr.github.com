10.3.  Timing Attacks
-----------------------------------

When cryptographic algorithms 
are implemented in such a way that 
successful operations take a different amount of time 
than unsuccessful operations, 
attackers may be able to use the time difference 
to obtain information about the keys employed.  

Therefore,
such timing differences must be avoided.
