4.3.  Private Header Parameter Names
------------------------------------------------

A producer and consumer of a JWS may agree to any header parameter name 
that is not a :ref:`Reserved Name Section 4.1 <jws.4.1>` or 
a :ref:`Public Name Section 4.2 <jws.4.2>`. 

Unlike :ref:`Public Names <jws.4.2>`, 
these private names are subject to collision and should be used with caution.

New header parameters should be introduced sparingly, 
as they can result in non-interoperable JWSs.
