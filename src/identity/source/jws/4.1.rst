4.1.  Reserved Header Parameter Names
------------------------------------------------------------------

The following header parameter names are reserved with meanings as defined below.  
All the names are short 
because a core goal of JWSs is for the representations to be compact.

Additional reserved header parameter names MAY be defined 
via the IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Header Parameters registry [:term:`JWA`].  
As indicated by the common registry, 
JWSs and JWEs share a common header parameter space; 
when a parameter is used by both specifications, 
its usage must be compatible between the specifications.
