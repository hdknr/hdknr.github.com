10.7.  Unicode Comparison Security Considerations
----------------------------------------------------

Header Parameter names and algorithm names are Unicode strings.  

For security reasons, 
the representations of these names must be compared verbatim 
after performing any escape processing 
(as per Section 8.3 of [RFC7159]).  

This means, 
for instance, 
that these JSON strings must compare as being equal 
("sig", "\u0073ig"), 
whereas these must all compare as being not equal 
to the first set or to each other ("SIG", "Sig", "si\u0047").

JSON strings can contain characters 
outside the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane.  

For instance, 
the G clef character (U+1D11E) may be represented in a JSON string 
as "\uD834\uDD1E".  

Ideally, 
JWS implementations SHOULD ensure that characters outside the Basic
Multilingual Plane are preserved and compared correctly;
alternatively, 
if this is not possible due to these characters
exercising limitations present in the underlying JSON implementation,
then input containing them MUST be rejected.
