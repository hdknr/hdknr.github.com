4.1.4.  "x5u" (X.509 URL) Header Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "x5u" (X.509 URL) header parameter is an absolute URL 
that refers to a resource for the X.509 public key certificate 
or certificate chain corresponding to the key 
used to digitally sign the JWS.  

The identified resource MUST provide a representation of the certificate
or certificate chain that conforms to RFC 5280 [RFC5280] 
in :term:`PEM` encoded form RFC 1421 [RFC1421].  

The certificate containing the public key of the entity 
that digitally signed the JWS MUST be the first certificate.  
This MAY be followed by additional certificates,
with each subsequent certificate being the one used to certify the previous one.  

The protocol used to acquire the resource MUST provide integrity protection; 
an HTTP GET request to retrieve the certificate MUST use 
TLS RFC 2818 [RFC2818] RFC 5246 [RFC5246]; 
the identity of the server MUST be validated, 
as per Section 3.1 of HTTP Over TLS [RFC2818].  
This header parameter is OPTIONAL.
