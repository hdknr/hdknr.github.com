4.1.7. "kid" (Key ID) Header Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "kid" (key ID) header parameter is a **hint** indicating 
which key was used to secure the JWS.  
This allows originators to explicitly signal a change of key to recipients.  
Should the recipient be unable to locate a key corresponding to the "kid" value, 
they SHOULD treat that condition as an error.  
The interpretation of the contents of the "kid" parameter is unspecified.  
Its value MUST be a string.  This header parameter is OPTIONAL.
