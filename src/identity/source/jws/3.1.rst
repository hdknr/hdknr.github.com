3.1.  Example JWS
---------------------------

The following example JWS Header declares that the encoded object is a JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT] and the JWS Header and the JWS Payload are signed using the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm:

::

    {"typ":"JWT",
     "alg":"HS256"}

Base64url encoding the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JWS Header yields this Encoded JWS Header value:

::

    eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLA0KICJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9

The following is an example of a JSON object that can be used as a JWS Payload. (Note that the payload can be any content, and need not be a representation of a JSON object.)

::

    {"iss":"joe",
    "exp":1300819380,
    "http://example.com/is_root":true}

Base64url encoding the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JSON object yields the following Encoded JWS Payload.

::

    eyJpc3MiOiJqb2UiLA0KICJleHAiOjEzMDA4MTkzODAsDQogImh0dHA6Ly9leGFtcGxlLmNvbS9pc19yb290Ijp0cnVlfQ

Signing the UTF-8 representation of the JWS Signing Input (the concatenation of the Encoded JWS Header, a period ('.') character, and the Encoded JWS Payload) with the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm and base64url encoding the result, as per Section 6.1, yields this Encoded JWS Signature value:

::

This computation is illustrated in more detail in Appendix A.1.
