8.  TLS Requirements
================================

Implementations MUST support TLS.  Which version(s) ought to be
implemented will vary over time, and depend on the widespread
deployment and known security vulnerabilities at the time of
implementation.  At the time of this writing, TLS version 1.2
[RFC5246] is the most recent version.

To protect against information disclosure and tampering,
confidentiality protection MUST be applied using TLS with a
ciphersuite that provides confidentiality and integrity protection.

Whenever TLS is used, the identity of the service provider encoded in
the TLS server certificate MUST be verified using the procedures
described in Section 6 of RFC 6125 [RFC6125].
