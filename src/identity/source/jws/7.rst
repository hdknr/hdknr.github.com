7.  Serializations
=======================================

JWS objects use one of two serializations, 
the JWS :ref:`Compact Serialization <jws.compact_serialization>` 
or the :ref:`JWS JSON Serialization <jws.json_serialization>`.  

Applications using this specification need to specify 
what serialization and serialization features are used for that application.  

For instance, 
applications might specify that 
only the :ref:`JWS JSON Serialization <jws.json_serialization>` is used, 
that only :ref:`JWS JSON Serialization <jws.json_serialization>` support 
for a single signature or MAC value is used, 
or that support for multiple signatures and/or MAC values is used.  

JWS implementations only need to implement the features 
needed for the applications they are designed to support.
