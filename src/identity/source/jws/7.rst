7.  Serializations
=======================================

JWS objects use one of two serializations, the JWS Compact
Serialization or the JWS JSON Serialization.  Applications using this
specification need to specify what serialization and serialization
features are used for that application.  For instance, applications
might specify that only the JWS JSON Serialization is used, that only
JWS JSON Serialization support for a single signature or MAC value is
used, or that support for multiple signatures and/or MAC values is
used.  JWS implementations only need to implement the features needed
for the applications they are designed to support.
