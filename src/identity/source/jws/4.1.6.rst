4.1.6. "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) Header Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) header parameter contains 
the X.509 public key certificate or certificate chain [RFC5280]
corresponding to the key used to digitally sign the JWS.  

The certificate or certificate chain is represented as 
an array of certificate values.  
Each value is a base64 encoded 
([RFC4648] Section 4 - not base64url encoded) :term:`DER` 
[ITU.X690.1994] PKIX certificate value.  
The certificate containing the public key of the entity 
that digitally signed the JWS MUST be the first certificate.
This MAY be followed by additional certificates, 
with each subsequent certificate being the one used to certify the previous one.  
The recipient MUST verify the certificate chain according 
to [RFC5280] and reject the JWS if any validation failure occurs.  
This header parameter is OPTIONAL.

See :ref:`Appendix B <jws.appendix.b>` for an example "x5c" value.
