4.1.6. "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) Header Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) header parameter contains 
the X.509 public key certificate or certificate chain 
corresponding to the key used to digitally sign the JWS.  

The certificate or certificate chain is represented as an array of certificate values.

Each value is a base64-encoded (**not base64url encoded**) 
:term:`DER`/:term:`BER` :term:`PKIX` certificate value.  

The certificate containing the public key of the entity that digitally signed the JWS 
MUST be the first certificate.  
This MAY be followed by additional certificates, 
with each subsequent certificate being the one used to certify the previous one.  
The recipient MUST verify the certificate chain according to [RFC5280]
and reject the JWS if any validation failure occurs.  
This header parameter is OPTIONAL.
