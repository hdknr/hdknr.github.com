4.1.6.  "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) Header Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) header parameter contains the
X.509 public key certificate or certificate chain [RFC5280]
corresponding to the key used to digitally sign the JWS.  

The certificate or certificate chain is represented as an array of
certificate value strings.  Each string is a base64 encoded
([RFC4648] Section 4 -- not base64url encoded) DER [ITU.X690.1994]
PKIX certificate value.  The certificate containing the public key of
the entity that digitally signed the JWS MUST be the first
certificate.  This MAY be followed by additional certificates, with
each subsequent certificate being the one used to certify the
previous one.  The recipient MUST verify the certificate chain
according to [RFC5280] and reject the JWS if any validation failure
occurs.  Use of this header parameter is OPTIONAL.

See Appendix B for an example "x5c" value.
