4.  JWS Header
========================

The members of the JSON object represented by the JWS Header describe the signature applied to the Encoded JWS Header 
and the Encoded JWS Payload and optionally additional properties of the JWS. 

Implementations MUST understand the entire contents of the header; otherwise, the JWS MUST be rejected for processing.
