4.  JWS Header
========================

The members of the JSON object(s) representing the JWS Header
describe the :term:`digital signature` or :term:`MAC` 
applied to the JWS Protected Header and the JWS Payload 
and optionally additional properties of the JWS.  

The Header Parameter names within the JWS Header 
MUST be unique; 
recipients MUST either reject JWSs with duplicate Header Parameter names 
or use a JSON parser that returns only the lexically last duplicate member name, 
as specified in Section 15.12 (The JSON Object) of ECMAScript 5.1 [ECMAScript].



Implementations are required to understand 
the specific Header Parameters defined by this specification 
that are designated as "MUST be understood" 
and process them in the manner defined in this specification.  

All other Header Parameters defined by this specification 
that are not so designated MUST be ignored when not understood.  

Unless listed as a critical Header Parameter, 
per :ref:`Section 4.1.10 <jws.4.1.10>`, 
all Header Parameters not defined by this specification 
MUST be ignored when not understood.

There are three classes of Header Parameter names: 
:ref:`Registered Header Parameter <jws.4.1>` names, 
:ref:`Public Header Parameter <jws.4.2>` names, and 
:ref:`Private Header Parameter <jws.4.3>` names.
