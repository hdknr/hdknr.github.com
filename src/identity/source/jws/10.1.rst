10.1.  Key Entropy
--------------------

Keys are only as strong as the amount of entropy used to generate
them.  A minimum of 128 bits of entropy should be used for all keys,
and depending upon the application context, more may be required.  In
particular, it may be difficult to generate sufficiently random
values in some browsers and application environments.
