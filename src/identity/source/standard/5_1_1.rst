5.1.1.  Access Token Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To obtain a :term:`access token assertion`, 
the client MUST send the following parameters via HTTPS POST 
to the :term:`Token endpoint` using application/x-www-form-urlencoded format 
in the HTTP request entity-body as specified in :ref:`Section 4.1.3 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth.2.0] <oauth_4_1_3>`:

    grant_type
        REQUIRED. A string "**authorization_code**". 

    code
        REQUIRED. The authorization code received from the authorization server. 

    redirect_uri
        REQUIRED, if the redirect_uri parameter was included in the authorization request 
        described in :ref:`Section 4.1.1 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth.2.0] <oauth_4_1_1>`, and their values MUST be identical. 


If the client type is confidential or was issued client credentials (or assigned other authentication requirements), 
the client MUST authenticate with the authorization server as described in :ref:`Section 3.2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth.2.0] <oauth_3_2_1>`.

The following is a non-normative example. Line wraps after line 4 are for display purpose only:

::

    POST /token HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8
    
    grant_type=authorization_code&code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb

The authorization server MUST:

    -   require client authentication for confidential clients or for any client issued client credentials 
        (or with other authentication requirements),

    -   authenticate the client if client authentication is included 
        and ensure the authorization code was issued to the authenticated client,

    -   verify that the authorization code is valid, and

    -   ensure that the redirect_uri parameter is present 
        if the redirect_uri parameter was included in the initial authorization request and that their values are identical.
