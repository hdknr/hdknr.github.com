3.  Token Endpoint
========================

The :term:`Token Endpoint` handles requests for retrieving and refreshing :term:`Access Tokens` 
as well as :term:`ID Token` and other variables.

:term:`Clients` MUST use the HTTP "**POST**" method to make requests to the :term:`Token Endpoint`. 
Request parameters are added using :term:`form serialization`.

:term:`Clients` MAY provide authentication parameters in the request to the :term:`Token Endpoint` 
as described in :ref:`section 2.2.1 of OpenID Connect Messages <messages_2_2_1>` [:term:`OpenID.Messages`]

:term:`Authorization Servers` MUST support the use of the HTTP "**POST**" method 
defined in RFC 2616 [:term:`RFC2616`] at the :term:`Token Endpoint`.

:term:`Authorization Servers` MUST require the use of a transport-layer security mechanism. 
The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST support TLS 1.2 as described in RFC 5246 [:term:`RFC5246`] 
and MAY support other transport-layer mechanisms with equivalent security.

All :term:`Token Endpoint` responses 
that contain tokens, secrets, or other sensitive information MUST include the following HTTP response header fields and values:
