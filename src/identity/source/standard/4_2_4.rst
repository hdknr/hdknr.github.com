4.2.4.  Authorization Server Obtains the End-User Consent/Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the user is authenticated, the Authorization Server MUST obtain an authorization decision. 
This MAY be done by presenting the user with a dialogue that allows the user to recognize what he is consenting to and obtain his consent or by establishing approval via other means (for example, via previous administrative approval).

The Authorization Server MUST attempt to request authorization from the user in the following cases:

    - The End-User has not pre-authorized the client for the authorization request.

    - The Authorization Request contains the prompt parameter with a value "consent". 
      The Authorization Server MUST request user authorization even if the user has previously authorized the client.

The Authorization Server MUST NOT request user authorization in the following cases:

     - The Authorization Request contains the "display" parameter with a value "none". 
       The Authorization Server MUST return an error if the user has not pre-authorized the client.
