2.3.1.3.1.  Client Generates the URL of the Request File
########################################################################

The :term:`Client` then stores the :term:`Request File` 
either locally or remotely. 
This is the :term:`Request URI`, ":term:`request_uri`". 
The URI MAY be appended with the SHA256 [:term:`FIPS180-2`] 
hash of the file after "#" so that the :term:`Authorization Server` can detect whether the file has changed. 
"#" MUST be escaped.

It should be noted that 
if the :term:`Request File` includes user's attribute values, 
it MUST NOT be revealed to anybody but the :term:`Authorization Server`. 
As such, the ":term:`request_uri`" MUST have an appropriate entropy for its lifetime, 
and must be removed after successful authentication or a reasonable timeout.

The :term:`Client` then records the :term:`Request File` either locally or remotely 
and obtains the :term:`Request File URI`, ":term:`request_uri`".
