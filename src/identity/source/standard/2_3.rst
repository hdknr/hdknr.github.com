2.3.  Authorization Request
------------------------------

When the :term:`End-User` wishes to access a :term:`Protected Resource`, 
and the :term:`End-User Authorization` has not yet been obtained, 
the :term:`Client` prepares an :term:`Authorization Request` to the :term:`Authorization Endpoint`.

:term:`Authorization Servers` MUST require the use of a transport-layer security mechanism 
at the :term:`Authorization Endpoint`. 
The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST support TLS 1.2 as described in RFC 5246 [:term:`RFC5246`] 
and MAY support other transport-layer mechanisms with equivalent security.

:term:`Authorization Servers` MUST support the use of the HTTP "GET" and "POST" methods 
defined in RFC 2616 [:term:`RFC2616`] at the :term:`Authorization Endpoint`.

:term:`Clients` MAY use the HTTP "GET" or "POST" method 
to send the :term:`Authorization Request` to the :term:`Authorization Server`. 
If using the HTTP "GET" method, 
the request parameters are serialized using :term:`URI query string serialization`. 
If using the HTTP "POST" method, 
the request parameters are serialized using :term:`form serialization`.


(draft 07)


.. note::

    An anonymous session  may be provided to an user agent, and bind the Authorization Request to it.
    Session key MUST be unique to every each use agent, and not be hijaked by others as an web application.
