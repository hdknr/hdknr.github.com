2.2.1.  How to Get an Authorization Code, Access Token, and ID Token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST support both the **code** and the '**id_token token**' :term:`response_type`.

The :term:`Client` may request any :term:`OAuth 2.0` registered :term:`response type` supported by the :term:`Authorization Server`.

The :term:`OAuth 2.0` specification documents two :term:`response types`:

.. glossary::

    code
        When supplied as the value for the :term:`response_type` parameter, 
        a successful response MUST include an :term:`Authorization Code` 
        as defined in the OAuth 2.0 specification. 
        Both successful and error responses MUST be added as parameters 
        to the :term:`query component` of the response. 
        All tokens are returned from the :term:`Token Endpoint`. 
        :term:`Authorization Servers` MUST support this :term:`response_type`. 

    token
        When supplied as the value for the :term:`response_type` parameter, 
        a successful response MUST include an :term:`Access Token` 
        as defined in the :term:`OAuth 2.0` specification. 
        Both successful and error responses MUST be :term:`fragment-encoded`. 
        No :term:`ID Token` is provided to the :term:`Client`. 

OpenID Connect supports these additional flows [:term:`RESPONSE.TYPES`] that have been registered:

    id_token
        When supplied as the value for the :term:`response_type` parameter, 
        a successful response MUST include an :term:`ID Token`. 
        Both successful and error responses SHOULD be :term:`fragment-encoded`. 
        :term:`Authorization Servers` SHOULD support this :term:`response_type`. 

    id_token token
        When supplied as the value for the :term:`response_type` parameter, 
        a successful response MUST include both an :term:`Access Token` as well as an :term:`ID Token`. 
        Both successful and error responses SHOULD be :term:`fragment-encoded`. 
        :term:`Authorization Servers` MUST support this :term:`response_type`. 

    code token
        When supplied as the value for the :term:`response_type` parameter,     
        a successful response MUST include both an :term:`Access Token` and an :term:`Authorization Code`
        as defined in the :term:`OAuth 2.0` specification. 
        Both successful and error responses SHOULD be :term:`fragment-encoded`. 

    code id_token
        When supplied as the value for the :term:`response_type` parameter, 
        a successful response MUST include both an :term:`Authorization Code` 
        as well as an :term:`ID Token`.

    code id_token token
        When supplied as the value for the :term:`response_type` parameter, 
        a successful response MUST include an :term:`Authorization Code`, 
        an :term:`ID Token`, and an :term:`Access Token`. 
        Both successful and error responses SHOULD be :term:`fragment-encoded`.
