6.  Discovery and Registration
=======================================

Some OpenID Connect installations can use a pre-configured set of OpenID Providers 
and/or Relying Parties. 
In those cases, 
it may not be necessary to support dynamic discovery of information 
about identities or services or dynamic registration of :term:`Clients`.

However, 
if installations choose to support unanticipated interactions 
between :term:`Relying Parties` and :term:`OpenID Providers` 
that do not have pre-configured relationships, 
they SHOULD accomplish this by implementing the facilities defined 
in the OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [:term:`OpenID.Discovery`] 
and OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 [:term:`OpenID.Registration`] specifications.
