4.1.1.3.3.  Authorization Server Fetches the Request File
############################################################


Upon receipt of the Request, 
the :term:`Authorization Server` MUST send a **GET** request to the request_uri to retrieve the content 
unless it is already cached and parse it to recreate the authorization request parameters.

.. note::

    It means that the URL must be unqiue for the unique content of Request File.

Following is a non-normative example of this fetch process. Note: Line wraps are for display purpose only:

::

   GET /rf.js HTTP/1.1
   Host: client.example.com
