4.1.2.  Authorization Server Authenticates the End-User
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`Authorization Server` **validates the request** [#]_  to ensure all required parameters are present and valid. 
If the request is valid, the authorization server MUST authenticate the End-User. 
The way in which the authorization server authenticates the End-User 
(e.g. username and password login, session cookies) is beyond the scope of this specification. 
An authentication user interface MAY be displayed by the Authorization Server depending on the authentication method used.

.. [#] Where should we go for validation ?  `Issue 149 <https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issue/149>`_

The Authorization Server MUST attempt to authenticate the user in the following cases:

    - The End-User is not already authenticated by the Authorization Server.

    - The Authorization Request contains the prompt parameter with a value "**login**". 
      The Authorization Server MUST reauthenticate the user even if the user is already authenticated.

The Authorization Server MUST NOT attempt authentication in the following cases:

     - The Authorization Request contains the "display" parameter with a value "none". 
       The Authorization Server MUST return an error if the user is unauthenticated.
