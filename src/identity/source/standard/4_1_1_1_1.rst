4.1.1.1.1.  Client sends a request to the Authorization Server
################################################################

Having constructed the URL, 
the client sends the End-User to the HTTPS End-User Authorization Endpoint using the URL. 
This MAY happen via HTTPS redirect, hyperlinking, or any other means of directing the User-Agent to the URL.

The Client SHOULD send the request using the HTTPS GET method, 
but MAY send it via the HTTPS POST if the authorization server supports it as defined in 
[W3C.REC‑html401‑19991224]

.. note::

    GET= MUST , POST=OPTIONAL

Following is a non-normative example using HTTP redirect. 
Note: Line wraps are for display purpose only.

::
