5.1.2.2.  Error Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    Negative Assertion could be better for consistency. `Issue 158 <https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issue/158/>`_

If the :term:`Token Request` is invalid or unauthorized, 
the :term:`Authorization Server` constructs the response by returning the 
:ref:`Token Error Response <messages_3_2_3>` defined in :doc:`OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages] <messages>`
in the entity body of the HTTP response using the application/json media type with HTTP response code 400.

Following is a non-normative example:

::

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json
    Cache-Control: no-store
    Pragma: no-cache
    
    {
      "error":"invalid_request"
    }
