Abstract
==============

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer 
on top of the :term:`OAuth` 2.0 protocol. 
It allows :term:`Clients` to verify the identity of the :term:`End-User` 
based on the authentication performed by an :term:`Authorization Server`, 
as well as to obtain basic profile information about the :term:`End-User` 
in an interoperable [#]_  and :term:`RESTful manner`.

OpenID Connect Standard 1.0 is an HTTP protocol binding 
for :doc:`OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 <messages>` request and response messages. 

.. [#] How interoperable ?
