9.  Privacy Considerations
================================

The :term:`UserInfo` response typically contains :term:`Personally Identifiable Information`. 
As such, 
:term:`End-User` consent for the release of the information 
for the specified purpose SHOULD be obtained at or prior to the authorization time 
in accordance with relevant regulations. 
The purpose of use is typically registered in association with the :term:`redirect_uri`.

Only necessary :term:`UserInfo` data should be stored at the :term:`Client` 
and the :term:`Client` SHOULD associate the received data with the purpose of use statement.

The :term:`Resource Server` SHOULD make the :term:`UserInfo` access log 
available to the :term:`End-User` so that the :term:`End-User` can monitor who accessed his data.

To protect the :term:`End-User` from a possible correlation among :term:`Clients`, 
the use of a :term:`Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier` (PPID) as the :term:`user_id` SHOULD be considered.
