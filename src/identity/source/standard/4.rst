4.  Check ID Endpoint
============================

The :term:`Check ID Endpoint` validates the :term:`ID Token` 
and returns a text JSON [:term:`RFC4627`] object 
containing the :term:`Claims` in the :term:`ID Token`. [#]_
This endpoint is used by :term:`Clients` that are not able to 
or do not wish to directly process :term:`ID Tokens`. 
In this case, :term:`clients` MAY treat :term:`ID Tokens` as opaque values.

:term:`Check ID Endpoints` MUST require the use of a transport-layer security mechanism. 
The endpoint MUST support TLS 1.2 as described in RFC 5246 [:term:`RFC5246`]; 
when TLS is used, 
the :term:`Client` MUST perform a TLS/SSL server certificate check, per RFC 6125 [:term:`RFC6125`]. 
:term:`Check ID Endpoints` MAY support other transport-layer mechanisms with equivalent security. 

.. [#]  Should refer to Messages spec ?
