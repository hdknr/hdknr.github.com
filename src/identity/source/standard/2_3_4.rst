2.3.4.  Authorization Server Obtains the End-User Consent/Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the :term:`End-User` is authenticated, 
the :term:`Authorization Server` MUST obtain an authorization decision. 
This MAY be done by presenting the :term:`End-User` with a dialogue 
that allows the :term:`End-User` to recognize 
what he is consenting to 
and obtain his consent or by establishing consent via other means (for example, via previous administrative consent).

The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST attempt to request authorization from the :term:`End-User` in the following cases:

    - The :term:`End-User` has not pre-authorized the :term:`Client` for the authorization request.
    - The :term:`Authorization Request` contains the prompt parameter with the value ":term:`consent`". 
      The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST request :term:`End-User` authorization 
      even if the :term:`End-User` has previously authorized the :term:`Client`.

The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST NOT request :term:`End-User` authorization in the following cases:

    - The :term:`Authorization Request` contains the ":term:`prompt`" parameter with the value ":term:`none`". 
      The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST return an error if the :term:`End-User` has not pre-authorized the :term:`Client`.
