4.1.4.1.  End-User Grants Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the :term:`resource owner` [#]_  grants the access request, 
the :term:`authorization server` issues an :term:`Authorization code` 
and delivers it to the client by adding the following parameters 
to the query component of the redirection URI using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format:

.. [#]  Should be "the End-User". Look at :ref:`4.1.2 <standard_4_1_2>`. `Issue 151  <https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issue/151/>`_

    code
        REQUIRED. The Authorization Code. 
    state
        REQUIRED if the "state" parameter in the request. Set to the exact value of the "state" parameter received from the client. 

.. note::
    What happens to response_type = "code id_token" case ? `Issue 152 <https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issue/152>`_

No other parameter SHOULD be returned. 
The entire URL MUST NOT exceed 512 bytes.

The following is a non-normative example.
