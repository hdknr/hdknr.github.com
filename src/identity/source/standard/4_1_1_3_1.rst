4.1.1.3.1.  Client Obtains the URL of the Request File
#################################################################

The Client then records the Request File either locally or 
remotely and obtains the Request URI, "request_uri".

Optionally, the Authorization Server may provide the :term:`Request File registration service`
at the :term:`Request Registration Endpoint`, 
which allows the Client to register the Request File 
and obtain the URL for it in exchange. 
This is especially useful for the cases when the RP is behind the firewall 
or lives on a client device that cannot be accessed from the Authorization Server.
