4.2.3.  Implicit Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The implicit flow follows the following steps:

    - Client prepares an Authorization Request containing the desired request parameters.
    - Client sends a request to the Authorization Server.
    - Authorization Server Authenticates the End-User
    - Authorization Server Obtains the End-User Consent/Authorization
    - Authorization Server Sends the End-User back to the Client with an Access Token and an ID Token if requested
    - (OPTIONAL) Client validates the ID Token at the Check ID Endpoint
    - (OPTIONAL) Client receives ID Token Response with the End-Users's identity
    - (OPTIONAL) Client accesses the UserInfo Endpoint with the Access Token
    - (OPTIONAL) Client receives UserInfo Response

Note that in each step, 
the party that receives a message MUST verify it according to the verification rule set 
in :doc:`OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages] <messages>`.
