2.3.3.  Authorization Server Authenticates the End-User
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`Authorization Server` validates the request 
to ensure all required parameters are present and valid. 
If the request is valid, 
the :term:`Authorization Server` MUST authenticate the :term:`End-User`. 
The way in which the :term:`Authorization Server` authenticates the :term:`End-User` 
(e.g. username and password login, session cookies) is beyond the scope of this specification. 
An authentication user interface MAY be displayed by the :term:`Authorization Server` 
depending on the authentication method used.

The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST attempt to authenticate the :term:`End-User` in the following cases:

    - The :term:`End-User` is not already authenticated by the :term:`Authorization Server`.
    - The :term:`Authorization Request` contains the :term:`prompt` parameter with the value ":term:`login`". 
      The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST reauthenticate the :term:`End-User` even if the :term:`End-User` is already authenticated.

The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST NOT attempt authentication in the following cases:

    - The :term:`Authorization Request` contains the ":term:`prompt`" parameter 
      with the value ":term:`none`". 
      The :term:`Authorization Server` MUST return an error if the :term:`End-User` is unauthenticated.


.. note::

    "none" ask User to have already authenticated and logged in to OP before he starts Connect activities.
