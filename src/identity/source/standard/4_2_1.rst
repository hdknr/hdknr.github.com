4.2.1.  Response Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To verify the validity of the :term:`Response <Check ID Response>`, 
the :term:`Client` MUST do the following:

    - The :term:`Check ID Endpoint` has not returned an error for the :term:`ID Token` being expired or invalid.
    - Check that the :term:`iss` (issuer) is equal to that of the pre-configured 
      or discovered :term:`Issuer Identifier` for the user session.
    - Check that the returned :term:`nonce` is equal to the :term:`nonce` in the :term:`Authorization Request`.
    - Verify that the :term:`aud` (audience) contained within the response is the :term:`Client`'s :term:`client_id`.
