4.2.  Check ID Response
--------------------------------

The :term:`Check ID Endpoint` MUST return the JSON serialized :term:`Claims` 
associated with the :term:`ID Token` 
as described in :term:`Check ID Response` section of OpenID Messages [:term:`OpenID.Messages`] 
in the HTTP response body. 
The **content-type** of the HTTP response MUST be set to **application/json**.

The following is a non-normative example of a response from a :term:`Check ID Endpoint`:

::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
     "iss": "http://server.example.com",
     "user_id": "248289761001",
     "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
     "nonce": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",
     "exp": 1311281970
    }
