4.1.1.3.  Request File Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The request file method differs from the other methods in that it uses a request file 
which contains all the authorization request parameters. 
It sends the request file URL to the authorization endpoint instead of the request parameters.

The Client prepares a file with a JSON serialized Authorization Request 
described in :doc:`OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages] <messages>` with a globally reachable URL. 
Optionally, the request may contain other **extension parameters**. 
It MAY be signed or signed and encrypted via JWS [JWS] and JWE [JWE] respectively, 
thereby providing authentication, integrity, non-repudiation and/or confidentiality.

Following is a non-normative example of a Request File. Note that the line wraps within the values are for display purpose only:

::

    {
        "response_type": "code id_token",
        "client_id": "s6BhdRkqt3",
        "redirect_uri": "https://client.example.com/cb",
        "scope": "openid",
        "state": "af0ifjsldkj"
    }
