2.1.  OpenID Connect Scopes
----------------------------------------

:term:`Clients` MUST specify 
the desired :term:`scopes` in an :term:`authorization request` to obtain an Access Token with the proper permissions.

:term:`Scopes` names defined for OpenID Connect are in :ref:`Section 2.1.2 <messages_2_1_1>` of 
OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [:term:`OpenID.Messages`]. 
OAuth 2.0 allows additional :term:`scopes` to be specified as extensions.

OpenID Connect's :term:`scope` use is consistent with :ref:`Section 3.3 <oauth_3_3>` of OAuth 2.0 [:term:`OAuth2.0`].

The :term:`Authorization Server` MAY fully or partially ignore the :term:`scope` 
requested by the :term:`Client` based on the :term:`Authorization Server` policy [#]_ or the :term:`End-User`'s instructions [#]_.

To increase new account activation, 
a :term:`Client` may elect to only request a subset of the information available from the :term:`UserInfo Endpoint`.

The following is a non-normative example of a :term:`Scope Request` [#]_ .
