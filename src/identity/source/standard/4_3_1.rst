4.3.1.  Client prepares an Authorization Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The client prepares an Authorization Request to the Authorization Endpoint 
with the request parameters using the HTTP "GET" or "POST" method. 
The scheme used in the Authorization URL MUST be HTTPS.

The required Authorization Request parameters are as follows:

.. glossary::

    response_type
        A space delimited, case sensitive list of values that specifies whether the Access Token, 
        Authorization Code, and ID Token are to be returned. 
        As described in :term:`How To Get An Authorization Code <standard_4_2_1>`, 
        Access Token, and ID Token , the following values are supported:

            code
            code id_token
            token
            token id_token
            code token
            code token id_token

    client_id
        The client identifier. 

    scope
        It MUST include openid as one of the strings. 
        Other values that MAY be included are profile, email, address, and PPID. 
        The values specify an additive list of claims that are returned by the UserInfo Endpoint 
        as described by OpenID Connect Scopes. 

    redirect_uri
        A redirection URI where the response will be sent. 
    nonce
        A random, unique string value used to mitigate replay attacks. 

The request can contain the following optional parameters:

.. glossary::

    state
        An opaque value used to maintain state between the request and the callback. 

    request
        A JWT [JWT] encoded OpenID Request Object. 

    request_uri
        A URL that points to an OpenID Request Object. 

    display
        A string value that specifies how the Authorization Server displays the authentication page to the user. 
        The following values are supported: **none** or **scopes**.  [#]_
        Refer to :ref:`OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages] <messages_3_1_2> for more information. 

    prompt
        A space delimited list that can contain login, consent, and select_account. 
        Refer to OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages] for more information

There are three methods to construct and send the request to the authorization endpoint:

    a.
        Simple Request Method 

    b.
        Request Parameter Method 

    c.
        Request File Method 

The Simple Request Method is used in simple cases when default UserInfo and ID Token claims are desired and requests and responses do not need to be signed or encrypted.

The Request Parameter Method is used by sending an OpenID Request Object when the client desires to retrieve a different set of UserInfo and ID Token claims. The request parameter method also allows requests and responses to be signed or encrypted.

The Request Rile Method works similar to the Request Parameter Method but differs in that it sends an URL as a reference to the OpenID Request Object. 
It enables large requests to be sent securely and compactly even on browsers with limited capabilities. 
Clients SHOULD use the request file method to minimize the request size.
