5.2.  UserInfo Response
---------------------------------

The :term:`user_id` claim in the :term:`UserInfo Endpoint` response 
MUST exactly match the :term:`user_id` claim in the :term:`ID Token`, 
before using additional :term:`UserInfo Endpoint` claims.

Upon receipt of the :term:`UserInfo request`, 
the :term:`UserInfo Endpoint` MUST return 
the :term:`JSON Serialization` of the :term:`UserInfo response` as in OpenID Messages [:term:`OpenID.Messages`] 
in the HTTP response body. 
The content-type of the HTTP response MUST be set to **application/json** 
if the response body is a text JSON structure. 
If the JSON response is JWS [:term:`JWS`] signed or JWE [:term:`JWE`] encrypted, 
then the content-type MUST be set to **application/jwt**.

Following is a non-normative example of such response:

::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
     "user_id": "248289761001",
     "name": "Jane Doe"
     "given_name": "Jane",
     "family_name": "Doe",
     "email": "janedoe@example.com",
     "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
    }

(draft 07)
