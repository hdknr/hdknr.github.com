5.  UserInfo Endpoint
===========================

To obtain the requested :term:`Claims` about the :term:`End-User`, 
the :term:`Client` makes a GET or POST request to the :term:`UserInfo Endpoint` 
as in :doc:`OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 <messages>` [:term:`OpenID.Messages`].

:term:`Authorization Servers` MUST require the use of a transport-layer security mechanism. 
The Authorization Server MUST support TLS 1.2 as described in RFC 5246 [:term:`RFC5246`] 
and MAY support other transport-layer mechanisms with equivalent security.

:term:`Authorization Servers` MUST support the use of the HTTP "GET" and HTTP "POST" methods 
defined in RFC 2616 [:term:`RFC2616`] at the :term:`UserInfo Endpoint`.

:term:`Authorization Servers` MUST be able to accept :term:`Access Tokens` 
via :term:`Bearer Tokens` [:term:`OAuth.Bearer`] specification.

Authorization Servers SHOULD support the use of :term:`Cross Origin Resource Sharing` (CORS) [:term:`CORS`] 
and or other methods as appropriate to enable Java Script Clients to access the endpoint.

(draft 08)

.. note::

    CORS supports was added on Draft 08 ( https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issue/550 )

    Thinking of the indirect binding for OP in intranet. Seems to be OpenID 2.0 AX with JWT.
