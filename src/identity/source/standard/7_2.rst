7.2.  Form Serialization
--------------------------------

Parameters and their values are form serialized 
by adding the parameter names 
and values to the entity body of the HTTP request 
using the **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** format 
as defined by [:term:`W3C.REC‑html401‑19991224`]. 
Form serialization is typically used in HTTP POST requests.

Following is a non-normative example of such serialization:

::

    POST /authorize HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    
    scope=openid&response_type=code
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb
