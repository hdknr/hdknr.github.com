4.1.1.3.2.  Client Sends a Request to Authorization Server via HTTPS Redirect
###################################################################################

.. note::

    Only HTTPS Redirect is allowed for this method ? `Issue 150 <https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issue/150>`_

The Client sends the user to the HTTPS End-User Authorization Endpoint 
through the HTTP 302 redirect with the following parameters

    response_type
        REQUIRED. "code". 

    client_id
        REQUIRED. The Client Identifier. 

    request_uri
        REQUIRED. The Request URI. 

    state
        OPTIONAL. An opaque value used by the Client to maintain state between the request and callback. If provided, the Authorization Server MUST include this value when redirecting the user-agent back to the Client. Clients are strongly advised to use this variable to relate the request and response. 


.. note::

    Nonce ?  `Issue 147 <https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issue/147/>`_

The entire URL MUST NOT exceed 512 bytes.

The Client SHOULD send the request using the HTTP GET method, 
but MAY send it via the HTTP POST if the authorization server supports it as defined in 
[W3C.REC‑html401‑19991224]

Following is a non-normative example. Note: Line wraps are for display purpose only:

::

     HTTP/1.1 302 Found
     Location: https://server.example.com/authorize?response_type=code%20id_token&cliend_id=s6BhdRkqt3
     &request_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Frf%2Ejs
