6.1.  UserInfo Request
------------------------------------

Client SHOULD send the UserInfo request defined in section 3.3 of the OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages] either in HTTP GET or POST request.

The request parameters are the following:

    access_token
        REQUIRED. The access_token obtained from an OpenID Connect authorization request. This parameter MUST NOT be sent if the access token is sent in the HTTP Authorization header as described in Section 7.1 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth.2.0]. Access tokens sent in the authorization header must be Bearer tokens [OAuth.2.0.Bearer]. If the client is using the HTTP GET method, it SHOULD send the access token in the authorization header. 

    schema
        OPTIONAL. The schema in which the data is to be returned. The only predefined value is openid. If this parameter is not included, the response may be a proprietary schema to support backwards compatibility. A URL MAY be passed to define custom schemes not specified by short names. Custom scheme names and responses are out of scope for this specification. 

    id
        This identifier is reserved for backwards compatibility. It MUST be ignored by the endpoint if the openid schema is used. 

The following is a non-normative example. Line wraps are for display purpose only:

::

    POST /userinfo HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    
    access_token=SlAV32hkKG
