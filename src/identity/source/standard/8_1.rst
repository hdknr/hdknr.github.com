8.1.  Implicit Grant Flow Threats
------------------------------------------

In the :term:`implicit grant flow`, 
the :term:`Access Token` is returned 
in the :term:`fragment part` of the :term:`Client`'s :term:`redirect_uri` through HTTPS, 
thus it is protected between the :term:`OP` and the :term:`User-Agent`, 
and :term:`User-Agent` and the :term:`RP`. 
The only the place it can be captured is the :term:`User-Agent` 
where the TLS session is terminated, 
and is possible if the User-Agent is infested by malware. 

.. note::

    :term:`ARP Spoofing` can read the SSL packet.
