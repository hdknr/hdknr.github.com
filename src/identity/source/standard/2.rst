2.  Authorization Endpoint
================================

The :term:`Authorization Endpoint` performs authentication services for the :term:`End-User` 
and requests authorization from the :term:`End-User` to release information to OpenID Connect :term:`Relying Party Clients`. 
When an :term:`End-User` accesses a :term:`Relying Party Client` application 
which requires the :term:`End-User`'s identifier and other information, 
it sends the :term:`End-User` to the :term:`Authorization Server`'s :term:`Authorization Endpoint` 
for authentication and authorization. 
The :term:`Authorization Server` then issues 
an :term:`ID Token` which asserts the :term:`End-User`'s identifier and 
an :term:`Access Token` which allows the :term:`Client` to access the :term:`End-User`'s information 
at :term:`Protected Resource` endpoints. 
:term:`Protected Resource` endpoints MAY perform different actions or return different information 
based on the :term:`scopes` associated with the presented :term:`Access Token`. 
:term:`Clients` MUST specify how the :term:`Access Token` and :term:`ID Token` are to be returned 
using the :term:`response_type` parameter in the :term:`Authorization Request`.
