6.2.  UserInfo Response
-------------------------------

Upon receipt of the UserInfo request, the UserInfo endpoint MUST return the JSON Serialization of the UserInfo response as in OpenID Messages [OpenID.Messages] in the HTTP response body. The content-type of the HTTP response MUST be set to application/json if the response body is a text JSON structure. If the JSON response is JWS [JWS] signed or JWE [JWE] encrypted, then the content-type MUST be set to application/jwt.

Following is a non-normative example of such response:

::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
     "name": "Jane Doe"
     "given_name": "Jane",
     "family_name": "Doe",
     "email": "janedoe@example.com",
     "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
    }
