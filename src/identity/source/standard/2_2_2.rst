2.2.2.  Authorization Code Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`Authorization Code Flow` goes through the following steps.

    1.  :term:`Client` prepares an :term:`Authorization Request` containing the desired request parameters.
    2.  :term:`Client` sends a request to the :term:`Authorization Server`.
    3.  :term:`Authorization Server` Authenticates the :term:`End-User`.
    4.  :term:`Authorization Server` Obtains the :term:`End-User` Consent/Authorization.
    5.  :term:`Authorization Server` Sends the :term:`End-User` back to the :term:`Client` with an :term:`Authorization Code`.
    6.  :term:`Client` requests a response using the :term:`Authorization Code` at the :term:`Token Endpoint`.
    7.  :term:`Client` receives a response which contains an :term:`Access Token` and :term:`ID Token` in the response body.
    8.  (OPTIONAL) :term:`Client` validates the :term:`ID Token` at the :term:`Check ID Endpoint`.
    9.  (OPTIONAL) :term:`Client` receives :term:`ID Token Response` with the :term:`End-User`'s identifier.
    10. (OPTIONAL) :term:`Client` accesses the :term:`UserInfo Endpoint` with the :term:`Access Token`.
    11. (OPTIONAL) :term:`Client` receives :term:`UserInfo Response`.

Note that in each step, 
the party that receives a message MUST verify it according to the verification rule set 
in OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [:term:`OpenID.Messages`].
