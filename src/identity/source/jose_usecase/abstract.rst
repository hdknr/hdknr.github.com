Abstract
====================

.. note::
    ASN.1 -> JSON

Many Internet applications have a need for **object-based security mechanisms** 
in addition to security mechanisms at the **network layer** or **transport layer**.  

In the past, 
the Cryptographic Message Syntax has provided a binary secure object format based on :term:`ASN.1`.  
Over time, 
the use of binary object encodings such as ASN.1 has been overtaken
by text-based encodings, for example :term:`JavaScript Object Notation`.

This document defines a set of use cases and requirements 
for a secure object format encoded using JavaScript Object Notation, 
drawn from a variety of application security mechanisms currently in development.
