4.  Requirements on Application Protocols
============================================================

The JOSE secure object formats describe 
how cryptographic processing is done on secured content, 
ensuring that the **recipient** 
an object is able to properly decrypt an encrypted object 
or verify a signature.  

In order to make use of JOSE, however, 
applications will need to specify several aspects of 
how JOSE is to be used:

-   What application content is to be protected

-   Which cryptographic algorithms are to be used

-   How application protocol entities establish keys

-   Whether keys are to be explicitly indicated in JOSE objects, 
    or associated by application context

-   What serializations of JOSE objects are to be used
