   S1 
      (同じ共有キーとMACを使い回さない事)

      Provide mechanisms 
      to avoid repeated use of the same symmetric key for encryption 
      or MAC computation.  

      Instead, 
      long-lived keys should be used only for key wrapping, 
      not for direct encryption/MAC.  

      It should be possible to use any of the key management
      techniques provided in CMS :term:`[RFC5652]`:

      *  Key transport (wrapping for a public key)

      *  Key encipherment (wrapping for a symmetric key)

      *  Key agreement (wrapping for a DH public key)

      *  Password-based encryption 
         (wrapping under a key derived from a password)


   S2 
      (キー管理)

      Where long-lived symmetric keys are used directly for
      cryptographic operations 
      (i.e., where requirement S1 is not met),
      provide deployment guidance on key management practices, 
      such as the need to limit key lifetimes.

   S3 
      (広く使われる検証プロセスと互換のあるアルゴリズム)

      Use cryptographic algorithms in a manner compatible 
      with major validation processes.  

      For example, 
      if typical validation standards allow algorithm A 
      to be used for purpose X 
      but not purpose Y, 
      then JOSE should not recommend using algorithm A for purpose Y.

   S4 
      (特定の事前ネゴシエーションに依存しない)

      Support operation with or without pre-negotiation.  

      It must be possible to create or process secure objects 
      without any configuration beyond key provisioning.  

      If it is possible for keys to be derived from application context, 
      it must be possible for a recipient 
      to recognize when it does not have the appropriate key.
