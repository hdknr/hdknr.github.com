5.1.  Security Tokens
---------------------------

Security tokens are a common use case 
for object-based security, 
for example, 
:term:`SAML assertions` :term:`[OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os]`.  

Security tokens are used to convey information 
about a **subject entity** 
("claims" or "assertions") from an **issuer** to a **recipient**.  

The security features of a token format enable 
the **recipient** to verify that the claims came from the **issuer** and, 
if the object is confidentiality-protected, 
that they were not visible to other parties.

Security tokens are used in federation protocols 
such as SAML 2.0 [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os], 
WS-Federation [WS-Federation], Mozilla Persona [Persona], and 
OpenID Connect [OpenID.Messages], 
as well as in resource authorization protocols 
such as OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749],
including for OAuth bearer tokens [RFC6750].  

In some cases, 
security tokens are used for client authentication and 
for access control 
:term:`[I-D.ietf-oauth-jwt-bearer]`
:term:`[I-D.ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer]`.

:doc:`JSON Web Token <jwt>` (JWT) [I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token] 
is a security token format 
based on JSON and JOSE.  

It is used with Mozilla Persona, OpenID Connect, and OAuth.  

Because JWTs are often used in contexts with limited space 
(e.g., HTTP query parameters), 
it is a core requirement for JWTs, 
and thus JOSE, to have a compact, URL-safe representation.
