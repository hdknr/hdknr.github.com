6.1.  Functional Requirements
--------------------------------------------

.. glossary::

    F1  
       (認証,完全性)
    
       Define formats for secure objects that provide the following
       security properties:
    
       *  Digital signature 
          (integrity/authentication under an asymmetric key pair)
    
       *  Message authentication 
          (integrity/authentication under a symmetric key)
    
       *  Authenticated encryption
    
    F2 
       (秘密鍵、公開鍵書式)
    
       Define a format for public keys and private keys 
       for asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, 
       with associated attributes, 
       including a wrapped form for private keys.
    
    F3
       (共有鍵の書式)
    
       Define a format for symmetric keys with associated attributes,
       allowing for both wrapped and unwrapped keys.
    
    
    F4  
       (オブジェクト永続化書式)
    
       Define a JSON serialization for each of the above objects.  
    
       An object in this encoding must be valid according 
       to the JSON ABNF syntax :term:`[RFC4627]`.
    
    F5 
       (小さくてURLセーフな書式)
    
       Define a compact, 
       URL-safe text serialization for the encrypted signed object formats.
    
    F6 
       (キーラッピング)
    
       Allow for attributes associated to wrapped keys 
       to be bound to them cryptographically
    
    F7 
       (ラップ化キーと暗号化オブジェクトの分離)
    
       Allow for wrapped keys to be separated 
       from a secure object that uses a symmetric key.  
    
       In such cases, 
       cryptographic components of the secure object other 
       than the wrapped key 
       (e.g., ciphertext, MAC values) must be independent 
       of the wrapped form of the key.
    
       For example, 
       if an encrypted object is prepared for multiple recipients, 
       then only the wrapped key may vary, 
       not the ciphertext.
    
    F8 
       (小さなオーバーヘッド)
    
       Do not impose more overhead than is required to meet the
       requirements in this document, especially when a large amount of
       application content is being protected.
