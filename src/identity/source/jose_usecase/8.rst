8.  Security Considerations
================================================

The primary focus of this document 
is the requirements for a JSON- based secure object format.  

At the level of general security considerations 
for object-based security technologies, 
the security considerations for this format are the same as for CMS [RFC5652].

The primary difference between the JOSE format and CMS is that 
JOSE is based on JSON, 
which does not have a canonical representation.  

The lack of a canonical form means that it is difficult to determine
whether two JSON objects represent the same information, 
which could lead to vulnerabilities in some usages of JOSE.
