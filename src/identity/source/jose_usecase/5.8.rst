5.8.  Constrained Devices
---------------------------------

This section describes use cases for constrained devices 
as defined in :term:`[I-D.ietf-lwig-terminology]`.  

Typical issues with this type of devices are limited memory, 
limited power supply, 
low processing power, 
and severe message size limitations for the communication protocols.
