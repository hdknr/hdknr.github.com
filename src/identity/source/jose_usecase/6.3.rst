   D1 
      (WebCrypto互換)

      Maximize compatibility with the W3C WebCrypto specifications,
      e.g., 
      by coordinating with the WebCrypto working group 
      to encourage alignment of algorithms and algorithm identifiers.

   D2 
      (base64urlでJSONをカノニカライズ)

      Avoid JSON canonicalization to the extent possible.  

      That is, 
      all other things being equal, 
      techniques that rely on fixing a serialization of an object 
      (e.g., by base64url encoding it) are preferred 
      over those that require converting an object to a canonical form.

   D3 
      (元データは可能なかぎりアプリケーション制御できること)

      Maximize the extent to which the inputs and outputs 
      of JOSE cryptographic operations can be controlled by the applications, 
      as opposed to involving processing specific to JOSE.  

      This allows JOSE the flexibility to address the needs of 
      many cryptographic protocols.  

      For example, in some cases, 
      might allow JOSE objects to be translated to legacy formats 
      such as CMS without the need for re-encryption or re-signing.
