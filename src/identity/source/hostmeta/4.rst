4.  Processing host-meta Documents
========================================

Once the host-meta document has been obtained, the client processes
its content based on the type of information desired: host-wide or
resource-specific.

Clients usually look for a link with a specific relation type or
other attributes.  In such cases, the client does not need to process
the entire host-meta document and all linked LRDD documents, but
instead process the various documents in their prescribed order until
the desired information is found.

Protocols using host-meta must indicate whether the information they
seek is host-wide or resource-specific -- for example, "obtain the
first host-meta resource-specific link using the 'author' relation
type".  If both types are used for the same purpose (e.g., first look
for resource-specific, then look for host-wide), the protocol must
specify the processing order.
