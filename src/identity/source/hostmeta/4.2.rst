4.2.  Resource-Specific Information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike host-wide information, which is contained solely within the
host-meta document, resource-specific information is obtained from
host-meta link templates, as well as from linked LRDD documents.

When looking for resource-specific information, the client constructs
a resource descriptor by collecting and processing all the host-meta
link templates.  For each link template:

1.  The client applies the URI of the desired resource to the
    template, producing a resource-specific link.

2.  If the link's relation type is other than "lrdd", the client adds
    the link to the resource descriptor in order.

3.  If the link's relation type is "lrdd":

    3.1.  The client obtains the LRDD document by following the
          scheme-specific rules for the LRDD document URI.  If the
          document URI scheme is "http" or "https", the document is
          obtained via an HTTP "GET" request to the identified URI.
          If the HTTP response status code is 301, 302, or 307, the
          client MUST follow the redirection response and repeat the
          request with the provided location.

    3.2.  The client adds any links found in the LRDD document to the
          resource descriptor in order, except for any link using the
          "lrdd" relation type (processing is limited to a single
          level of inclusion).  When adding links, the client SHOULD
          retain any extension attributes and child elements if
          present (e.g., <Property> or <Title> elements).

    3.3.  The client adds any resource properties found in the LRDD
          document to the resource descriptor in order (e.g., <Alias>
          or <Property> child elements of the LRDD document <XRD>
          root element).
