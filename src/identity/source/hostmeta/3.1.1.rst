3.1.1.  The "Link" Element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The XRD "Link" element, when used with the "href" attribute, conveys
a link relation between the host described by the document and a
common target URI.

For example, the following link declares a common copyright license
for the entire scope:

.. code-block:: xml

  <Link rel='copyright' href='http://example.com/copyright' />

However, a "Link" element with a "template" attribute conveys a
relation whose context is an individual resource within the host-meta
document scope, and whose target is constructed by applying the
context resource URI to the template.  The template string MAY
contain a URI string without any variables to represent a resource-
level relation that is identical for every individual resource.

For example, a blog with multiple authors can provide information
about each article's author by providing an endpoint with a parameter
set to the URI of each article.  Each article has a unique author,
but all share the same pattern of where that information is located:

.. code-block:: xml

  <Link rel='author'
   template='http://example.com/author?article={uri}' />
