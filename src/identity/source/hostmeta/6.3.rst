6.3.  The "lrdd" Relation Type
--------------------------------------------------------

This specification registers the "lrdd" relation type 
in the Link Relation Type Registry defined by [RFC5988]:

   Relation Name:  lrdd

   Description:  Refers to further information about the link's context,
      expressed as a LRDD ("Link-based Resource Descriptor Document")
      resource.  See RFC 6415 for information about processing this
      relation type in host-meta documents.  When used elsewhere, it
      refers to additional links and other metadata.  Multiple instances
      indicate additional LRDD resources.  LRDD resources MUST have an
      "application/xrd+xml" representation, and MAY have others.

   Reference:  RFC 6415
