3.1.  XML Document Format
---------------------------

The host-meta document root MUST be an "XRD" element.  The document
SHOULD NOT include a "Subject" element, as at this time no URI is
available to identify hosts.  The use of the "Alias" element in
host-meta is undefined and NOT RECOMMENDED.

The subject (or "context IRI", as defined by [RFC5988]) of the XRD
"Property" and "Link" elements is the host described by the host-meta
document.  However, the subject of "Link" elements with a "template"
attribute is the individual resource whose URI is applied to the link
template, as described in Section 3.1.1.
