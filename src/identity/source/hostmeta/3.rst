3.  The host-meta Document
================================================

The host-meta document uses the XRD 1.0 document format as defined by
[OASIS.XRD-1.0], which provides a simple and extensible XML-based
schema for describing resources.  This specification defines
additional processing rules needed to describe hosts.  Documents MAY
include any elements included in the XRD 1.0 schema that are not
explicitly excluded by this specification.

The server MAY offer alternative representations of any XRD document
it serves (host-meta, LRDD, or other XRD-based documents).  The
client MAY request a particular representation using the HTTP
"Accept" request header field.  If no "Accept" request header field
is included with the request, or if the client requests an
"application/xrd+xml" representation, the server MUST respond using
the REQUIRED XRD 1.0 XML representation described in Section 3.1.

Applications using the host-meta document MAY require the server to
provide a specific alternative representation in addition to the
XRD 1.0 XML representation when explicitly requested by the client.

A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Resource Descriptor, known as
JRD, is described in Appendix A.  It is RECOMMENDED that servers
offer the JRD representation in addition to the XRD representation.
