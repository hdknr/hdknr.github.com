2.  Obtaining host-meta Documents
=================================================

The client obtains the host-meta document 
for a given host by sending an HTTP [RFC2616] 
or an HTTPS [RFC2818] GET request to the host 
for the "/.well-known/host-meta" path, 
using the default ports defined for each protocol 
(e.g., port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS).

The scope and meaning of host-meta documents obtained via other
protocols or ports is undefined.

The server MUST support at least one protocol but MAY support both.
If both protocols are supported, they MUST produce the same document.

The decision as to which protocol is used to obtain the host-meta
document has significant security ramifications, as described in
Section 5.

For example, the following request is used to obtain the host-meta
document for the 'example.com' host:

::

  GET /.well-known/host-meta HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com

If the server response indicates that the host-meta resource is
located elsewhere (a 301, 302, or 307 response status code), the
client SHOULD try to obtain the resource from the location provided
in the response.  This means that the host-meta document for one host
MAY be retrieved from another host.  Likewise, if the resource is not
available or does not exist (e.g., a 404 or 410 response status
code), the client SHOULD infer that metadata is not available via
this mechanism.

The host-meta document SHOULD be served with the
"application/xrd+xml" media type.
