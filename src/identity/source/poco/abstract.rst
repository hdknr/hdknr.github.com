Abstract
==========

The Portable Contacts specification is designed to make it easier for developers 
to give their users a secure way to access the **address books**
and **friends lists**  they have built up all over the web. 
Specifically, it seeks to create a **common access pattern** and **contact schema** that any site can provide, 
well-specified authentication and access rules, standard libraries 
that can work with any site, and absolutely minimal complexity, 
with the lightest possible toolchain requirements for developers.

By far the easiest way to start understanding this spec is 
to jump to the example in the :ref:`Appendix <poco_appendix_a>`. 
The format and meaning of the response should be readily apparent, 
and the majority of this document is merely an attempt to formalize 
the details of what should be relatively clear from this example.
