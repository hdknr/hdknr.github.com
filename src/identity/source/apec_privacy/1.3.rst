As both **business operations** and **consumer expectations** continue to shift 
due to changes in technology and the nature of information flows, 
businesses and other organizations require simultaneous input and access 
to data 24-hours a day in order to meet customer and societal needs, 
and to provide efficient and cost-effective services. 

Regulatory systems 
that unnecessarily restrict this flow or place burdens on it 
have adverse implications for global business and economies.Â 

Therefore, 
in promoting and enforcing ethical information practices, 
there is also a need to develop systems 
for protecting information privacy 
that account for these new realities in the global environment.
