benefits available to their citizens and businesses, personal information should be
collected, held, processed, used, transferred, and disclosed in a manner that protects
individual information privacy and allows them to realize the benefits of information
flows within and across borders.

Economies, consistent with the APEC Privacy Framework and any existing domestic
privacy protections, should take all reasonable and appropriate steps to identify
and remove unnecessary barriers to information flows and avoid the creation of any
such barriers.
