Information and communications technologies, 
including **mobile** technologies, 
that link to the Internet and other information networks 
have made it possible 
to collect, store and access information 
from anywhere in the world. 

These technologies offer great potential 
for social and economic benefits for business, 
individuals and governments, 
including increased consumer choice, market expansion, productivity,
education and product innovation.

However, 
while these technologies make it easier and cheaper to collect, 
link and use large quantities of information, 
they also often make these activities undetectable to individuals. 

Consequently, 
it can be more difficult for individuals 
to retain a measure of control over their :term:`personal information`. 

.. note::
    - 消費者が集められた情報にアクセスすることが難しい
    - 個人情報を制御する手段の維持が難しい

As a result, 
individuals have become concerned about the harmful consequences 
that may arise from the **misuse** of their information. 

Therefore, 
there is a need to promote and enforce 
ethical and trustworthy information practices 
in on- and off-line contexts 
to bolster the confidence of individuals and businesses.
