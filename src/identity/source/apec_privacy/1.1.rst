APEC economies recognize 
the importance of protecting :term:`information privacy` and
maintaining :term:`information flows` 
among economies in the Asia Pacific region and
among their trading partners. 

As APEC Ministers acknowledged 
in endorsing the 1998 :term:`Blueprint for Action on Electronic Commerce`, 
the potential of electronic commerce 
cannot be realized without government and business cooperation 
“to develop and implement technologies and policies, 
which build trust and confidence in safe, secure 
and reliable communication, 
information and delivery systems, 
and which address issues including privacy...". 

The lack of consumer **trust** and **confidence**
in the privacy and security of :term:`online transactions` 
and :term:`information networks` 
is one element that may prevent member economies 
from gaining all of the benefits of electronic commerce. 

APEC economies realize that 
a key part of efforts to improve consumer confidence 
and ensure the growth of electronic commerce 
must be cooperation to balance and promote both effective information privacy protection
and the free flow of information in the Asia Pacific region.
