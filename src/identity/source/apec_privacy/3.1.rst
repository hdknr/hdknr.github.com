14. PRINCIPLES
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recognizing the interests of the individual 
to legitimate expectations of privacy, 
personal information protection should be designed 
to prevent the misuse of such information. 

Further, 
acknowledging the risk that harm may result 
from such misuse of personal information,
specific obligations should take account of such risk, 
and remedial measures should be proportionate
to the likelihood and severity of the harm 
threatened by the collection, use and transfer of personal information.

14. COMMENTARY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`Preventing Harm Principle <apec_privacy.14>` recognizes that 
one of the primary objectives of the APEC Privacy Framework 
is to prevent misuse of personal information 
and consequent harm to individuals. 

Therefore, 
privacy protections, 
including self-regulatory efforts, 
education and awareness campaigns, 
laws, regulations, and enforcement mechanisms, 
should be designed to prevent harm to individuals
from the wrongful collection and misuse
of their personal information. 

Hence,
remedies for privacy infringements 
should be designed to prevent harms resulting 
from the wrongful collection or misuse of personal information,
and should be proportionate to the likelihood 
and severity of any harm threatened by the collection 
or use of personal information.
