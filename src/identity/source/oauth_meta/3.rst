3. JSON Meta Object
============================================


A JSON Meta Object uses the format described in :term:`[RFC4627]` 
and is intended to be inserted into a JSON document 
to express some of the :term:`metadata` associated with it as ":term:`_links`" member.

The value of the "_links" member is a **JSON object** 
that expresses :term:`link relationships` ("rel"), 
which in turn holds an object with "href" 
and other members or an array of such objects.

Following non-normative schematic example should help envisage what
it would look like.  
(Note: line-wraps are for display purpose only.)

.. code-block:: json

         {
           "_links":{
             "self":{"href":"https://example.com/token?code=123"},
             "http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/#userinfo_ep":[
               {
                 "href":"https://example.com/user/{user_id}",
                 "method":"GET",
                 "Authorize":"{token_type} {access_token}"
               },
               {
                 "href":"https://example.com/user/{user_id}",
                 "method":"POST",
                 "Authorize":"{token_type} {access_token}",
                 "params":[
                   "name","birthday"
                 ]
               }
           },
           "token_type":"Bearer",
           "access_token":"aCeSsToKen"
         }

Here, we have "_links" member that expresses various "relations" 
such as "self" and "http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/#userinfo_ep".

Each relationships has either a :term:`link relations object` 
or an array of link relations objects as its value.  


The link relations objects holds various members such as "href".  
They are explained in the next section.

.. note::

    - 上のJSONの例では２つのリレーションシップを含んでいます
        - self
        - Connect UserInfo

    - リレーションシップは、
        - リレーションシップオブジェクト
        - リレーションシップオブジェクトの配列
