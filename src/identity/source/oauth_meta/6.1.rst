6.1. href tampering
---------------------------

Unless integrity protected channel is used, an attacker may be able
to tamper the value of the href thereby causing the receiver of the
JSON response to send a request to the URL under the attacker's
control with potentially confidential information contained in the
parameters.  To mitigate this risk, an integrity protected channel
such as TLS protected channel should be used.
