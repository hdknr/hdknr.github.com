1. Introduction
==========================================

Although OAuth 2.0 :term:`[RFC6749]` has been known 
for its REST friendliness, 
OAuth itself is not RESTful, 
as it heavily relies on **out-of-band information** to drive the interactions.  

This situation can be eased by hypertext-enabling the JSON responses 
through the introduction of a member that represents such hypertext 
and other metadata.  

To achieve this, 
this specification introduces a top level member ":term:`_links`" 
that represents various :term:`link relationships` and other :term:`metadata`.
