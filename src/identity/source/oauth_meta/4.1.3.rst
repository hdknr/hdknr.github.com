4.1.3. Protected Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each protected resources MUST provide a unique :term:`Relation Name` 
by either registering to the :term:`Link Relation Type Registry` defined in
section 6.2 of :term:`[RFC5988]` or providing an absolute URI that provides a
collision registant name.  

The value is an array of objects that has the following members.

.. glossary::

   href  
      REQUIRED.  The URI template that describes the request to the
      resource as described in href (Section 3.1.1).

   method  
      OPTIONAL.  HTTP request method to be used as described in
      method (Section 3.1.2).  Defaults to "GET".  Semantics of the HTTP
      methods in this case SHOULD map as follows: "GET" means reading
      the resource.  "POST" means creating or updating the resource with
      supplied parameters in "params" member below.  "DELETE" means
      deleting the corresponding resource.  "PUT" means the complete
      replacement of the resource by the body of the request.  The
      resource MUST support "GET" method.  The support of other methods
      are OPTIONAL.

   params  
      OPTIONAL.  Parameters to be sent as described in params
      (:ref:`Section 3.1.3 <oauth_meta.3.1.3>`).

   content-type  
      OPTIONAL.  As described in content-type (:ref:`Section 3.1.4 <oauth_meta.3.1.4>`).

   Authorize  
      OPTIONAL.  HTTP Authorization header to be sent when
      accessing the resource.  This is described in Authorize
      (Section 3.1.5).  If this member is not available, then the client
      SHOULD access the expanded "href" value to obtain the
      Authorization header response to learn what authorization scheme
      it should use.
