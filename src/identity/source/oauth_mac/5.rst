5. Use with OAuth 2.0
============================

:term:`OAuth 2.0` ([I-D.ietf-oauth-v2]) defines 
an extensible token-based authentication framework.  
The :term:`MAC authentication scheme` can be used
to make OAuth-based requests by issuing :term:`MAC-type access tokens`.

This specification does not define methods 
for the :term:`client` to specifically request a :term:`MAC-type token` 
from the :term:`authorization server`.
Additionally, 
it does not include any discovery facilities for identifying 
which HMAC algorithms are supported by a resource server,
or how the client may go about obtaining MAC access tokens for any
given protected resource.
