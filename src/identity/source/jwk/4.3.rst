4.3. "kid" (Key ID) Parameter
--------------------------------

.. note::
    - kid is UNIQUE in :term:`JWK Set`
    - But, uniquness MUST be checked. ( :ref:`jwk.7` )

The "kid" (key ID) member can be used to match a specific key.  This
can be used, for instance, to choose among a set of keys within the
JWK during :term:`key rollover`.  The interpretation of the "kid" value is
unspecified.  Key ID values within a :term:`JWK Set` need not be unique.  
The "kid" value is a case sensitive string.  This member is OPTIONAL.
When used with JWS or JWE, the "kid" value MAY be used to match a JWS
or JWE "kid" header parameter value.

In some contexts, different keys using the same Key ID value might be
present, with the keys being disambiguated using other information,
such as the "alg" or ":term:`use`" values.  
For example, imagine "kid" values
like "Current", "Upcoming", and "Deprecated", used for key rollover
guidance.  One could apply a label to all keys where the
classification fits.  If there are multiple "Current" keys, then in
this example, they might be differentiated either by having different
"alg" or "use" values, or some combination of both.  As one example,
there might only be one current RSA signing key and one current
Elliptic Curve signing key, but both would be "Current".
