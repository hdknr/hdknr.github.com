3.4.  "kid" (Key ID) Parameter
------------------------------------

The "kid" (key ID) member can be used to match a specific key.  This
can be used, for instance, to choose among a set of keys within a JWK
Set during key rollover.  The interpretation of the "kid" value is
unspecified.  When "kid" values are used within a JWK Set, different
keys within the JWK Set SHOULD use distinct "kid" values.  The "kid"
value is a case sensitive string.  Use of this member is OPTIONAL.

When used with JWS or JWE, the "kid" value can be used to match a JWS
or JWE "kid" header parameter value.
