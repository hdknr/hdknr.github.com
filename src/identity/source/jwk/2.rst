    Base64url Encoding
        For the purposes of this specification, 
        this term always refers to the URL- and filename-safe Base64 encoding 
        described in RFC 4648 [:term:`RFC4648`], Section 5, 
        with the (non URL-safe) '=' padding characters omitted, 
        as permitted by Section 3.2. (See Appendix C of [:term:`JWS`] for notes on implementing base64url encoding without padding.)
