4. JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) Format
===================================================


   A JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) is a JSON object representing a set of
   JWKs.  The JSON object MUST have a "keys" member, which is an array
   of JWK objects.

   The member names within a JWK Set MUST be unique; recipients MUST
   either reject JWK Sets with duplicate member names or use a JSON
   parser that returns only the lexically last duplicate member name, as
   specified in Section 15.12 (The JSON Object) of ECMAScript 5.1
   [ECMAScript].

   Additional members can be present in the JWK Set; if not understood
   by implementations encountering them, they MUST be ignored.
   Parameters for representing additional properties of JWK Sets should
   either be registered in the IANA JSON Web Key Set Parameters registry
   defined in Section 7.4 or be a value that contains a Collision-
   Resistant Name.

   Implementations SHOULD ignore JWKs within a JWK Set that use "kty"
   (key type) values that are not understood by them, are missing
   required members, or for which values are out of the supported
   ranges.
