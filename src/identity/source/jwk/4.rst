4.  JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) Format
====================================================

   A JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) is a JSON object that contains an array
   of JSON Web Key values as the value of its "keys" member.

   The member names within a JWK Set MUST be unique; objects with
   duplicate member names MUST be rejected.

   Additional members MAY be present in the JWK Set. If not understood
   by implementations encountering them, they MUST be ignored.
   Parameters for representing additional properties of JWK Sets SHOULD
   either be registered in the IANA JSON Web Key Set Parameters registry
   Section 7.2 or be a value that contains a Collision Resistant
   Namespace.
