4. JSON Web Key (JWK) Format
=============================================

A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JSON object containing specific members, 
as specified below.  
Those members that are common to all key types are defined below.

In addition to the common parameters, 
each JWK will have members that are specific to the key being represented.  
These members represent the parameters of the key.  
:ref:`Section 5 of the JSON Web Algorithms <jwa.5>` (JWA) [JWA] specification 
defines multiple kinds of public keys and their associated members.

The member names within a JWK MUST be unique; 
objects with duplicate member names MUST be rejected.

Additional members MAY be present in the JWK.  
If present, 
they MUST be understood by implementations using them.  
Member names used for representing key parameters for different kinds of keys 
need not be distinct.  
Member names SHOULD either be registered in the :term:`IANA JSON Web Key Parameters` registry Section 6.1 
or be URIs that contain a :term:`Collision Resistant Namespace`.
