8. Security Considerations
====================================


   All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
   must be faced by a JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  Among these issues are
   protecting the user's private and symmetric keys, preventing various
   attacks, and helping the user avoid mistakes such as inadvertently
   encrypting a message for the wrong recipient.  The entire list of
   security considerations is beyond the scope of this document, but
   some significant considerations are listed here.

   One should place no more trust in the data associated with a key than
   in than the method by which it was obtained and in the
   trustworthiness of the entity asserting an association with the key.
   Any data associated with a key that is obtained in an untrusted
   manner should be treated with skepticism.

   Private and symmetric keys MUST be protected from disclosure to
   unintended parties.  One recommended means of doing so is to encrypt
   JWKs or JWK Sets containing them by using the JWK or JWK Set value as
   the plaintext of a JWE.

   The security considerations in RFC 3447 [RFC3447] and RFC 6030
   [RFC6030] about protecting private and symmetric keys, key usage, and
   information leakage also apply to this specification.

   The security considerations in XML DSIG 2.0
   [W3C.CR-xmldsig-core2-20120124], about key representations also apply
   to this specification, other than those that are XML specific.

   The TLS Requirements in [JWS] also apply to this specification.
