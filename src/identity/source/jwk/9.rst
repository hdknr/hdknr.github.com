9. Security Considerations
====================================

All of the security issues 
that are pertinent to any cryptographic application 
must be addressed by JWS/JWE/JWK agents.  

Among these issues are protecting the user's asymmetric private 
and symmetric secret keys, 
preventing various attacks, 
and helping avoid mistakes 
such as inadvertently encrypting a message to the wrong recipient.

The entire list of security considerations is beyond the scope of
this document, but some significant considerations are listed here.
