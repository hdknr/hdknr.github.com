9. Security Considerations
====================================

All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
must be faced by a JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  

Among these issues are protecting the user's asymmetric private 
and symmetric secret keys,
preventing various attacks, 
and helping avoid mistakes such as inadvertently 
encrypting a message to the wrong recipient.  

The entire list of security considerations is beyond 
the scope of this document, 
but some significant considerations are listed here.
