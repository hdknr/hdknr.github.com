4.7. "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) Parameter
------------------------------------------------------

.. note::
    - base64 DER の json array
    - x5c[0] に、プライベートキーに対するパブリックキーを含むこと

The "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) member contains 
a chain of one or more PKIX certificates [RFC5280].  

The certificate chain is represented 
as a JSON array of certificate value strings.  

Each string in the array is a base64 encoded 
([RFC4648] Section 4 -- not base64url encoded) 
:term:`DER` [ITU.X690.1994] PKIX certificate value.  

The PKIX certificate containing the key value MUST 
be the first certificate.  

This MAY be followed by additional certificates, 
with each subsequent certificate being the one 
used to certify the previous one.  

The key in the first certificate MUST match the public key 
represented by other members of the JWK.  

Use of this member is OPTIONAL.

As with the "x5u" member, 
members other than those representing the public key may 
also be populated when an "x5c" member is present.  

If other members are present, 
the contents of those members MUST be semantically 
consistent with the related fields in the first certificate.  

See the last paragraph of :ref:`Section 3.6 <jwk.3.6>` for additional guidance on this.
