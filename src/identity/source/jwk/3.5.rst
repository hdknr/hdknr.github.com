3.5.  "x5u" (X.509 URL) Header Parameter
------------------------------------------

The "x5u" (X.509 URL) member is a URI [RFC3986] that refers to a
resource for an X.509 public key certificate or certificate chain
[RFC5280].  The identified resource MUST provide a representation of
the certificate or certificate chain that conforms to RFC 5280
[RFC5280] in PEM encoded form [RFC1421].  The key in the first
certificate MUST match the bare public key represented by other
members of the JWK.  The protocol used to acquire the resource MUST
provide integrity protection; an HTTP GET request to retrieve the
certificate MUST use TLS [RFC2818] [RFC5246]; the identity of the
server MUST be validated, as per Section 3.1 of HTTP Over TLS
[RFC2818].  Use of this member is OPTIONAL.
