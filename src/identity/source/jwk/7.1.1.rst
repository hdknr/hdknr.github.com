.. glossary::

   Parameter Name:
      The name requested (e.g., "example").  Because a core goal of this
      specification is for the resulting representations to be compact,
      it is RECOMMENDED that the name be short -- not to exceed 8
      characters without a compelling reason to do so.  This name is
      case-sensitive.  Names may not match other registered names in a
      case-insensitive manner unless the Designated Expert(s) state that
      there is a compelling reason to allow an exception in this
      particular case.  However, matching names may be registered,
      provided that the accompanying sets of "kty" values that the
      Parameter Name is used with are disjoint; for the purposes of
      matching "kty" values, "*" matches all values.

   Parameter Description:
      Brief description of the parameter (e.g., "Example description").

   Used with "kty" Value(s):
      The key type parameter value(s) that the parameter name is to be
      used with, or the value "*" if the parameter value is used with
      all key types.  Values may not match other registered "kty" values
      in a case-insensitive manner when the registered Parameter Name is
      the same (including when the Parameter Name matches in a case-
      insensitive manner) unless the Designated Expert(s) state that
      there is a compelling reason to allow an exception in this
      particular case.

   Parameter Information Class:
      Registers whether the parameter conveys public or private
      information.  Its value must be one the words Public or Private.

   Change Controller:
      For Standards Track RFCs, state "IESG".  For others, give the name
      of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal address,
      email address, home page URI) may also be included.

   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document(s) that specify the parameter,
      preferably including URI(s) that can be used to retrieve copies of
      the document(s).  An indication of the relevant sections may also
      be included but is not required.
