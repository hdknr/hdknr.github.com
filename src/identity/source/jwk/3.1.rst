3.1.  "kty" (Key Type) Parameter
---------------------------------------

.. note::
    - キータイプは必須です

The "kty" (key type) member identifies 
the cryptographic algorithm family used with the key. 

"kty" values should either be registered 
in the :term:`IANA JSON Web Key Types` registry defined in :term:`[JWA]` 
or be a value that contains a :term:`Collision-Resistant Name`.  

The "kty" value is a case-sensitive string.  

This member MUST be present in a JWK.



A list of defined "kty" values can be found 
in the IANA JSON Web Key Types registry defined in [JWA]; 
the initial contents of this registry are the values defined 
in :ref:`Section 6.1 <jwa.6.1>` of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) 
[JWA] specification.

The key type definitions include specification of 
the members to be used for those key types.  

Additional members used with "kty" values can also be found 
in the IANA JSON Web Key Parameters registry defined in :ref:`Section 7.1 <jwk.7.1>`.
