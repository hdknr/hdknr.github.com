4.2.  JWK Key Object Format
------------------------------------

A :term:`JWK Key Object` is a JSON object containing specific members. 
Those members that are common to all key types are as follows:

.. table::  JWK Key Object Members 

 =========== ===============    ====================================================================================================
 Member Name JSON Value Type    Key Object Member Semantics
 =========== ===============    ====================================================================================================
 alg         string             The alg member identifies the cryptographic algorithm family 
                                used with the key. 
                                Values defined by this specification are EC and RSA. 
                                Specific additional members are required to represent the key, 
                                depending upon the alg value. 
                                The alg value is case sensitive. 
                                This member is REQUIRED.
 use         string             The use member identifies the intended use of the key. 
                                Values defined by this specification are sig (signature) and enc (encryption). 
                                Other values MAY be used. 
                                The use value is case sensitive. 
                                This member is OPTIONAL.
 kid         string             The kid (Key ID) member can be used to match a specific key. 
                                This can be used, for instance, to choose among a set of keys within the JWK during key rollover. 
                                The kid value MAY correspond to a JWS kid value. 
                                The interpretation of the kid value is unspecified. 
                                This member is OPTIONAL.
 =========== ===============    ====================================================================================================
 

Additional members MAY be present in the JWK Key Object. 
If present, they MUST be understood by implementations using that key.
