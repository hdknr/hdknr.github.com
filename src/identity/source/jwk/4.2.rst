4.2.  "use" (Public Key Use) Parameter
---------------------------------------------

   The "use" (public key use) member identifies the intended use of the
   public key.  The "use" parameter is intended for use cases in which
   it is useful to distinguish between public signing keys and public
   encryption keys.  It is not intended for use cases in which private
   or symmetric keys may also be present.

   Values defined by this specification are:

   o  "sig" (signature)

   o  "enc" (encryption)

   Other values MAY be used.  Public Key Use values can be registered in
   the IANA JSON Web Key Use registry defined in Section 7.2.  The "use"
   value is a case-sensitive string.  Use of the "use" member is
   OPTIONAL, unless the application requires its presence.

   When a key is used to wrap another key and a key use designation for
   the first key is desired, the "enc" (encryption) key use value SHOULD
   be used, since key wrapping is a kind of encryption.  The "enc" value
   SHOULD also be used for public keys used for key agreement
   operations.  (The "alg" member can be used to specify the particular
   cryptographic operation to be performed, when desired.)
