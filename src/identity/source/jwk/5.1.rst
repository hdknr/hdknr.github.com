.. _jwk.keys:

5.1. "keys" Parameter
--------------------------------

   The value of the "keys" member is an array of JWK values.  By
   default, the order of the JWK values within the array does not imply
   an order of preference among them, although applications of JWK Sets
   can choose to assign a meaning to the order for their purposes, if
   desired.  This member MUST be present in a JWK Set.
