6. IANA Considerations
========================

The following registration procedure is used for all the registries
established by this specification.

Values are registered with a Specification Required :term:`[RFC5226]` after a
two week review period on the [TBD]@ietf.org mailing list, on the
advice of one or more Designated Experts.  However, to allow for the
allocation of values prior to publication, the Designated Expert(s)
may approve registration once they are satisfied that such a
specification will be published.

Registration requests must be sent to the [TBD]@ietf.org mailing list
for review and comment, with an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request
for access token type: example"). [[ Note to RFC-EDITOR: The name of
the mailing list should be determined in consultation with the IESG
and IANA.  Suggested name: jose-reg-review. ]]

Within the review period, the Designated Expert(s) will either
approve or deny the registration request, communicating this decision
to the review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation
and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request
successful.

IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Expert(s),
and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
list.
