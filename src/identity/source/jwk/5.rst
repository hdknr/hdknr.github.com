5.  Base64url encoding as used by JWKs
================================================

JWKs make use of the base64url encoding as defined in RFC 4648 [:term:`RFC4648`]. 
As allowed by Section 3.2 of the RFC, 
this specification mandates that base64url encoding when used with JWKs MUST NOT use padding. 
Notes on implementing base64url encoding can be found in the JWS [JWS] specification.
