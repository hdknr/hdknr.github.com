5. JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) Format
================================================

A JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) is a JSON object that 
contains an array of JSON Web Key values 
as the value of its "keys" member.

The member names within a JWK Set MUST be unique; objects 
with duplicate member names MUST be rejected.

Additional members MAY be present in the JWK Set. 
If present, 
they MUST be understood by implementations using them.  
Parameters for representing additional properties of JWK Sets 
SHOULD either be registered in the :term:`IANA JSON Web Key Set Parameters` 
registry Section 6.2
