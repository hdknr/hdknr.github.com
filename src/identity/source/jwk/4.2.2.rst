4.2.2.  JWK Key Object Members for RSA Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

JWKs can represent RSA [:term:`RFC3447`] keys. 
In this case, 
the :term:`alg` member value MUST be RSA. 
Furthermore, these additional members MUST be present:

 mod            string      The mod member contains the modulus value for the RSA public key. 
                            It is represented as the base64url encoding of the value's big endian representation.

 exp            string      The exp member contains the exponent value for the RSA public key. 
                            It is represented as the base64url encoding of the value's big endian representation.
