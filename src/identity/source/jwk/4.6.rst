4.6. "x5u" (X.509 URL) Parameter
---------------------------------------------------

The "x5u" (X.509 URL) member is a URI [RFC3986] 
that refers to a resource for an X.509 public key certificate 
or certificate chain [RFC5280].  

The identified resource MUST provide a representation of
the certificate or certificate chain 
that conforms to RFC 5280 [RFC5280] in PEM encoded form [RFC1421].  

The key in the first certificate MUST match 
the public key represented by other members of the JWK.  

The protocol used to acquire the resource MUST provide
integrity protection; an HTTP GET request to retrieve the certificate
MUST use TLS [RFC2818] [RFC5246]; the identity of the server MUST be
validated, as per Section 3.1 of HTTP Over TLS [RFC2818].  

Use of this member is OPTIONAL.

While there is no requirement that members other than those
representing the public key be populated when an "x5u" member is
present, 
doing so may improve interoperability for applications that
do not handle PKIX certificates.  

If other members are present, 
the contents of those members MUST be semantically 
consistent with the related fields in the first certificate.  

For instance, 
if the "use" member is present, 
then it needs to allow for only a subset of the usages 
that are permitted by the certificate.  

Similarly, 
if the "alg" member is present, 
it should represent an algorithm that the certificate allows.
