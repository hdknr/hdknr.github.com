1.  Introduction
===========================


   A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
   [I-D.ietf-json-rfc4627bis] data structure that represents a
   cryptographic key.  This specification also defines a JSON Web Key
   Set (JWK Set) JSON data structure for representing a set of JWKs.
   Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this
   specification are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)
   [JWA] specification and IANA registries defined by that
   specification.

   Goals for this specification do not include representing certificate
   chains, representing certified keys, and replacing X.509
   certificates.

   JWKs and JWK Sets are used in the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] and
   JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] specifications.

   Names defined by this specification are short because a core goal is
   for the resulting representations to be compact.
