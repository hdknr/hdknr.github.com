1.  Introduction
===========================

A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC7159]
data structure that represents a cryptographic key.  

This specification also defines 
a JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) JSON data structure 
that represents a set of JWKs.  

Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this specification 
are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification 
and IANA registries defined by that specification.

Goals for this specification do not include representing new kinds of
certificate chains, 
representing new kinds of certified keys, or replacing X.509 certificates.

JWKs and JWK Sets are used in the JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] and
JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] specifications.

Names defined by this specification are short because a core goal is
for the resulting representations to be compact.
