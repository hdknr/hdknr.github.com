3.8. "x5t" (X.509 Certificate SHA-1 Thumbprint) Parameter
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The "x5t" (X.509 Certificate SHA-1 Thumbprint) member is a base64url
   encoded SHA-1 thumbprint (a.k.a. digest) of the DER encoding of an
   X.509 certificate [RFC5280].  The key in the certificate MUST match
   the public key represented by other members of the JWK.  Use of this
   member is OPTIONAL.

   If, in the future, certificate thumbprints need to be computed using
   hash functions other than SHA-1, it is suggested that additional
   related JWK parameters be defined for that purpose.  For example, it
   is suggested that a new "x5t#S256" (X.509 Certificate Thumbprint
   using SHA-256) JWK parameter could be defined by registering it in
   the IANA JSON Web Key Parameters registry defined in Section 7.1.

   As with the "x5u" member, members other than those representing the
   public key may also be populated when an "x5t" member is present.  If
   other members are present, the contents of those members MUST be
   semantically consistent with the related fields in the referenced
   certificate.  See the last paragraph of Section 3.6 for additional
   guidance on this.
