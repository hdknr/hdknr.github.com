4.2.1.  JWK Key Object Members for Elliptic Curve Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

JWKs can represent Elliptic Curve [:term:`FIPS.186â€‘3`] keys. 
In this case, the alg member value MUST be EC. Furthermore, these additional members MUST be present:

 crv            string              The crv member identifies the cryptographic curve used with the key. 
                                    Values defined by this specification are P-256, P-384 and P-521. 
                                    Additional crv values MAY be used, 
                                    provided they are understood by implementations using that Elliptic Curve key. 
                                    The crv value is case sensitive.

 x              string              The x member contains the x coordinate for the elliptic curve point. 
                                    It is represented as the base64url encoding of the coordinate's big endian representation.

 y              string              The y member contains the y coordinate for the elliptic curve point. 
                                    It is represented as the base64url encoding of the coordinate's big endian representation.
