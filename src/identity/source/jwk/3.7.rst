3.7.  "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) Parameter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   x5c  The "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) member contains a chain of
      one or more PKIX certificates [RFC5280].  The certificate chain is
      represented as a JSON array of certificate value strings.  Each
      string in the array is a base64 encoded ([RFC4648] Section 4 --
      not base64url encoded) DER [ITU.X690.1994] PKIX certificate value.
      The PKIX certificate containing the key value MUST be the first
      certificate.  This MAY be followed by additional certificates,
      with each subsequent certificate being the one used to certify the
      previous one.  The key in the first certificate MUST match the
      bare public key represented by other members of the JWK.  Use of
      this member is OPTIONAL.
