3.7. "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) Parameter
------------------------------------------------------


   The "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) member contains a chain of one or
   more PKIX certificates [RFC5280].  The certificate chain is
   represented as a JSON array of certificate value strings.  Each
   string in the array is a base64 encoded ([RFC4648] Section 4 -- not
   base64url encoded) DER [ITU.X690.1994] PKIX certificate value.  The
   PKIX certificate containing the key value MUST be the first
   certificate.  This MAY be followed by additional certificates, with
   each subsequent certificate being the one used to certify the
   previous one.  The key in the first certificate MUST match the public
   key represented by other members of the JWK.  Use of this member is
   OPTIONAL.

   As with the "x5u" member, members other than those representing the
   public key may also be populated when an "x5c" member is present.  If
   other members are present, the contents of those members MUST be
   semantically consistent with the related fields in the first
   certificate.  See the last paragraph of Section 3.6 for additional
   guidance on this.
