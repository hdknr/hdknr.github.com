.. _jwk.kid:

4.5. "kid" (Key ID) Parameter
------------------------------------------

The "kid" (key ID) member can be used to match a specific key.  

This can be used, for instance, 
to choose among a set of keys 
within a JWK Set during key rollover.  

The structure of the "kid" value is unspecified.  

When "kid" values are used within a JWK Set, 
different keys within the JWK Set SHOULD use distinct "kid" values.  

(One example in which different keys might use the same "kid" value 
is if they have different "kty" (key type) values 
but are considered to be equivalent alternatives 
by the application using them.)  

The "kid" value is a case-sensitive string.  

Use of this member is OPTIONAL.

When used with JWS or JWE, 
the "kid" value is used to match a JWS or JWE "kid" Header Parameter value.
