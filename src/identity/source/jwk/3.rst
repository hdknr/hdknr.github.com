3.  JSON Web Key (JWK) Overview
========================================

It is sometimes useful to be able to reference public key representations, 
for instance, 
in order to verify the signature on content signed with the corresponding private key. 
The JSON Web Key (JWK) data structure provides a convenient JSON representation 
for sets of public keys utilizing either the Elliptic Curve or RSA families of algorithms.
