3.  JSON Web Key (JWK) Format
====================================================

A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JSON object containing specific members, 
as specified below.  
Those members that are common to all key types are defined below.

In addition to the common parameters, 
each JWK will have members that are specific to the kind of key being represented.  
These members represent the parameters of the key.  
:ref:`Section 5 of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) <jwa.5>` :term:`[JWA]` 
specification defines multiple kinds of cryptographic keys and their associated members.

The member names within a JWK MUST be unique; 
objects with duplicate member names MUST be rejected.

Additional members MAY be present in the JWK.  
If not understood by implementations encountering them, 
they MUST be ignored.  
Member names used for representing key parameters 
for different kinds of keys need not be distinct.  
Any new member name SHOULD either be registered in the IANA JSON Web Key Parameters registry Section 7.1
or be a value that contains a Collision Resistant Namespace.
