4.8.  "x5t" (X.509 Certificate SHA-1 Thumbprint) Parameter
------------------------------------------------------------------

The "x5t" (X.509 Certificate SHA-1 Thumbprint) member is a base64url
encoded SHA-1 thumbprint (a.k.a. digest) of the DER encoding of an
X.509 certificate [RFC5280].  The key in the certificate MUST match
the public key represented by other members of the JWK.  Use of this
member is OPTIONAL.

As with the "x5u" member, members other than those representing the
public key may also be populated when an "x5t" member is present.  If
other members are present, the contents of those members MUST be
semantically consistent with the related fields in the referenced
certificate.  See the last paragraph of Section 4.6 for additional
guidance on this.
