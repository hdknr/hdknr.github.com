7. Encrypted JWK and Encrypted JWK Set Formats
========================================================================================


   JWKs containing non-public key material will need to be encrypted in
   some contexts to prevent the disclosure of private or symmetric key
   values to unintended parties.  The use of an Encrypted JWK, which is
   a JWE with the UTF-8 encoding of a JWK as its plaintext value, is
   recommended for this purpose.  The processing of Encrypted JWKs is
   identical to the processing of other JWEs.  A "cty" (content type)
   Header Parameter value of "jwk+json" MUST be used to indicate that
   the content of the JWE is a JWK, unless the application knows that
   the encrypted content is a JWK by another means or convention.

   JWK Sets containing non-public key material will similarly need to be
   encrypted.  The use of an Encrypted JWK Set, which is a JWE with the
   UTF-8 encoding of a JWK Set as its plaintext value, is recommended
   for this purpose.  The processing of Encrypted JWK Sets is identical
   to the processing of other JWEs.  A "cty" (content type) Header
   Parameter value of "jwk-set+json" MUST be used to indicate that the
   content of the JWE is a JWK Set, unless the application knows that
   the encrypted content is a JWK Set by another means or convention.

   See Appendix C for an example encrypted JWK.
