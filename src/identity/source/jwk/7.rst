7. Security Considerations
==============================

All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
must be faced by a JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  Among these issues are
protecting the user's private key, preventing various attacks, and
helping the user avoid mistakes such as inadvertently encrypting a
message for the wrong recipient.  The entire list of security
considerations is beyond the scope of this document, but some
significant concerns are listed here.

A key is no more trustworthy than the method by which it was received.

Per :ref:`Section 4.3 <jwk.4.3>`, 
applications should not assume that ":ref:`kid`" values are unique within a :term:`JWK Set`.

.. note::
    - kid uniquness MUST be checked.

The security considerations in XML DSIG 2.0 :term:`[W3C.CR-xmldsig-core2-20120124]` ,
about public key representations also apply to this specification, 
other than those that are XML specific.
