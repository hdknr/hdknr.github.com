2.3. URI Query Parameter
-----------------------------------

When sending the :term:`access token` in the HTTP request URI, 
the client adds the :term:`access token` 
to the request URI :term:`query component` as defined
by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] 
using the ":term:`access_token`" parameter.

For example, the client makes the following HTTP request using
transport-layer security:

::

     GET /resource?access_token=mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com

The HTTP request URI query can include other request-specific parameters, 
in which case, 
the ":term:`access_token`" parameter MUST be
properly separated from the request-specific parameters 
using "&" character(s) (ASCII code 38).

For example:

::

    https://server.example.com/resource?access_token=mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM&p=q

Clients using the URI Query Parameter method SHOULD also send 
a :term:`Cache-Control` header containing the "**no-store"** option.  
Server success (2XX status) responses to these requests SHOULD contain 
a :term:`Cache-Control` header with the "**private**" option.

Because of the security weaknesses associated with the URI method
(see :ref:`Section 5 <oauth_bearer.5>`), 
including the high likelihood 
that the URL containing the :term:`access token` will be logged, 
it SHOULD NOT be used 
unless it is impossible to transport the :term:`access token` 
in the ":term:`Authorization`" request header field or 
the HTTP request entity-body.  
Resource servers MAY support this method.

This method is included to document current use; 
its use is not recommended, both due to its security deficiencies 
(see :ref:`Section 5 <oauth_bear.5>`)
and 
because it uses a reserved query parameter name, 
which is counter to URI namespace best practices, 
per the Architecture of the World Wide Web [W3C.REC-webarch-20041215].
