Abstract
===========

This specification describes how to use :term:`bearer tokens` 
in HTTP requests to access OAuth 2.0 :term:`protected resources`.  
Any party in possession of a :term:`bearer token` (a ":term:`bearer`") can use it 
to get access to the associated resources
(without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key).  
To prevent misuse, 
bearer tokens need to be protected from disclosure in storage and in transport.
