   Bearer Token
   Bearer Tokens
      A :term:`security token` with the property that 
      any party in possession of the token (a "bearer") can use the token 
      in any way that any other party in possession of it can.  

      Using a bearer token does not
      require a bearer to prove possession of cryptographic key material
      (proof-of-possession).

All other terms are as defined in ":doc:`The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework <oauth>`" :term:`[RFC6749]`.
