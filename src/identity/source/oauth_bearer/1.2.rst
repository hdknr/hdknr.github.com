1.2.  Terminology

.. glossary::

   Bearer Token
        A security token 
        with the property that any party in possession of the token (a "bearer") 
        can use the token in any way that any other party in possession of it can.  

        Using a bearer token does not require a bearer to prove possession of cryptographic key material
        (proof-of-possession).

All other terms are as defined in OAuth 2.0 Authorization [:term:`I-D.ietf-oauth-v2`].
