1.  Introduction
========================

:term:`OAuth` enables clients 
to access :term:`protected resources` 
by obtaining an :term:`access token`, 
which is defined in OAuth 2.0 Authorization [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] 
as "a string representing an :term:`access authorization` issued to the client", 
rather than using the resource owner's credentials directly.

Tokens are issued to clients by 
an :term:`authorization server` with the approval of the :term:`resource owner`.  
The client uses the :term:`access token` 
to access the :term:`protected resources` hosted by the :term:`resource server`.  
This specification describes 
how to make :term:`protected resource requests` 
when the OAuth :term:`access token` is a :term:`bearer token`.

This specification defines the use of bearer tokens over HTTP/1.1
[I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging] using TLS [:term:`RFC5246`] 
to access :term:`protected resources`.  
TLS is mandatory to implement and use with this specification; 
other specifications may extend this specification for use with other transport protocols.  
While designed for use with :term:`access tokens` resulting 
from OAuth 2.0 Authorization [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] flows 
to access OAuth protected resources, 
this specification actually defines a general HTTP authorization method
that can be used with bearer tokens 
from any source to access any resources protected by those :term:`bearer tokens`.
