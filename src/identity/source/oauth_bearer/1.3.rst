1.3.  Overview
--------------------------------------------

:doc:`OAuth <oauth>` provides a method for :term:`clients` 
to access a :term:`protected resource` 
on behalf of a :term:`resource owner`.  

In the general case, 
before a client can access a protected resource, 
it must first obtain an :term:`authorization grant` from the resource owner 
and then exchange the authorization grant for an :term:`access token`.  

The access token represents the grant's :term:`scope`, :term:`duration`, 
and other attributes granted by the authorization grant.  

The client accesses the protected resource 
by presenting the access token to the :term:`resource server`.  

In some cases, 
a client can directly present its own :term:`credentials <client credential>` 
to an :term:`authorization server` 
to obtain an access token 
without having to first obtain an authorization grant from a resource owner.


The access token provides an abstraction, 
replacing different authorization constructs 
(e.g., username and password, assertion) 
for a single token understood by the resource server.  

This abstraction enables issuing access tokens valid for a short time period, 
as well as removing the resource server's need 
to understand a wide range of authentication schemes.

                     Figure 1: Abstract Protocol Flow

The abstract OAuth 2.0 flow illustrated in Figure 1 describes the
interaction between the client, resource owner, authorization server,
and resource server (described in :term:`[RFC6749]`).  

The following two steps are specified within this document:

   (E)  The client requests the protected resource from the resource
        server and authenticates by presenting the access token.

   (F)  The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
        serves the request.

This document also imposes **semantic requirements** 
upon the access token returned in step (D).
