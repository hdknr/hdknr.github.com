5.1.  Security Threats
------------------------------------------

The following list presents several common threats against protocols
utilizing some form of tokens.  This list of threats is based on NIST
Special Publication 800-63 [NIST800-63].  Since this document builds
on the OAuth 2.0 Authorization specification [RFC6749], we exclude a
discussion of threats that are described there or in related documents.

Token manufacture/modification:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      An attacker may generate a bogus token or modify the token contents 
      (such as the authentication or attribute statements) of an existing token, 
      causing the resource server to grant inappropriate access to the client.  

      For example,
      an attacker may modify the token to extend the validity period; a
      malicious client may modify the assertion to gain access to
      information that they should not be able to view.

Token disclosure:  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      Tokens may contain authentication and attribute
      statements that include sensitive information.

Token redirect:  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      An attacker uses a token generated for consumption
      by one resource server to gain access to a different resource
      server that mistakenly believes the token to be for it.

Token replay:  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      An attacker attempts to use a token that has already
      been used with that resource server in the past.
