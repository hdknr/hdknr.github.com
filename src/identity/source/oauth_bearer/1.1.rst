1.1.  Notational Conventions
------------------------------------------

The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
document are to be interpreted as described in Key words for use in
RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels [RFC2119].

This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
HTTP/1.1, Part 1 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging], which is based upon
the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.
Additionally, the following rules are included from HTTP/1.1, Part 7
[I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth]: auth-param, auth-scheme, and b64token;
and from Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986]: URI-Reference.

Unless otherwise noted, all the protocol parameter names and values
are case sensitive.
