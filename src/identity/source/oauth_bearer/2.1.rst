2.1.  Authorization Request Header Field
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When sending the :term:`access token` in the ":term:`Authorization`" :term:`request header`
field defined by HTTP/1.1, Part 7 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth], the
client uses the "**Bearer**" :term:`authentication scheme` 
to transmit the :term:`access token`.

For example:

::

   GET /resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Authorization: Bearer vF9dft4qmT

The "Authorization" header field uses the framework defined by
HTTP/1.1, Part 7 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth] as follows:

::

   credentials = "Bearer" 1*SP b64token

The :term:`b64token syntax` was chosen over 
the alternative :term:`#auth-param syntax` also defined by HTTP/1.1, Part 7 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth]
both for simplicity and for compatibility with existing implementations.  
If additional parameters are needed in the future, a different scheme would need to be defined.

Clients SHOULD make authenticated requests with a :term:`bearer token` using
the "Authorization" request header field with the "Bearer" HTTP authorization scheme.  
Resource servers MUST support this method.
