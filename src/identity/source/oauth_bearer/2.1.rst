2.1.  Authorization Request Header Field
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When sending the access token in the "Authorization" request header
field defined by HTTP/1.1 :term:`[RFC2617]`, 
the client uses the "**Bearer**" authentication scheme to transmit the access token.

For example:

::

     GET /resource HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM

The syntax of the "Authorization" header field for this scheme
follows the usage of the Basic scheme defined in Section 2 of
[RFC2617].  

Note that, as with **Basic**, 
it does not conform to the generic syntax defined in Section 1.2 of :term:`[RFC2617]` 
but is compatible with the general authentication framework being developed for
HTTP 1.1 :term:`[HTTP-AUTH]`, 
although it does not follow the preferred practice outlined 
therein in order to reflect existing deployments.

The syntax for **Bearer** credentials is as follows:

::

     b64token    = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT /
                       "-" / "." / "_" / "~" / "+" / "/" ) *"="
     credentials = "Bearer" 1*SP b64token

Clients SHOULD make authenticated requests with a bearer token using
the "Authorization" request header field with the "Bearer" HTTP
authorization scheme.  Resource servers MUST support this method.
