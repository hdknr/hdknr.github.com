2.1.  Authorization Request Header Field
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When sending the :term:`access token` in the ":term:`Authorization`" :term:`request header`
field defined by HTTP/1.1, Part 7 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth], 
the client uses the "**Bearer**" :term:`authentication scheme` 
to transmit the :term:`access token`.

For example:

::

     GET /resource HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM

The "Authorization" header field uses the framework 
defined by HTTP/1.1, Part 7 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth] 
as follows:

::

     b64token    = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT /
                       "-" / "." / "_" / "~" / "+" / "/" ) *"="

     credentials = "Bearer" 1*SP b64token

Clients SHOULD make authenticated requests 
with a bearer token using the "Authorization" request header field 
with the "Bearer" HTTP authorization scheme.  
Resource servers MUST support this method.
