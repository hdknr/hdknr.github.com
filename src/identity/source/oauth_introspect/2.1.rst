2.1. Introspection Request
------------------------------------


.. glossary::

   token  
        REQUIRED.  
        
        The string value of the token.

   resource_id  
        OPTIONAL.  

        A service-specific string 
        identifying the resource that the client doing the introspection is asking about.

    token_type_hint  
        OPTIONAL.  

        A hint about the type of the token submitted for revocation.  

        Clients MAY pass this parameter in order to help the :term:`authorization server` 
        to optimize the token lookup.  

        If the server is unable to locate the token using the given hint, 
        it MUST extend its search accross all of its supported token types.  

        An authorization server MAY ignore this parameter,
        particularly if it is able to detect the token type automatically.
      
        Values for this field are defined in :doc:`OAuth Token Revocation <oauth_revocation>` :term:`[Revocation]`

.. note::
    - draft 04 で :term:`token_type_hint` が追加
    - Authz Serverが問い合わせのトークンの検索を効率的に行えるようになる

The endpoint MAY allow other parameters 
to provide context to the query.  

For instance, 
an authorization service may need 
to know the **IP address** of the Client 
in order to determine the appropriateness of the token being presented.

The endpoint SHOULD also require some form of authentication to access this endpoint, 
such as the :term:`Client Authentication` 
as described in :doc:`OAuth 2 Core Specification <oauth>` :term:`[RFC6749]` 
or a separate OAuth 2.0 Access Token.  

The methods of managing and validating these authentication
credentials are out of scope of this specification.
