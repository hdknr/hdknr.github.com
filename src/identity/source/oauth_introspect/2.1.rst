2.1. Introspection Request
------------------------------------


.. glossary::

   token  
        REQUIRED.  
        
        The string value of the token.

   resource_id  
        OPTIONAL.  

        A service-specific string 
        identifying the resource that the client doing the introspection is asking about.

The endpoint MAY allow other parameters 
to provide context to the query.  

For instance, 
an authorization service may need 
to know the IP address of the Client 
in order to determine the appropriateness of the token being presented.

The endpoint SHOULD also require some form of authentication to access this endpoint, 
such as the Client Authentication as described in OAuth 2 Core Specification [RFC6749] 
or a separate OAuth2 Access Token.  

The methods of managing and validating these authentication
credentials are out of scope of this specification.
