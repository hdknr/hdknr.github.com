4. Security Considerations
========================================================

If left unprotected and un-throttled, the Introspection Endpoint
could present a means for an attacker to poll a series of possible
token values, fishing for a valid token.  Therefore, the
Authorization Server SHOULD issue special client credentials to any
protected resources or clients that need to access the introspection
endpoint.  These credentials may be used directly at the endpoint, or
they may be exchanged for an OAuth2 Access token scoped specifically
for the Introspection Endpoint.
