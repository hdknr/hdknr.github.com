4. Security Considerations
========================================================

If left unprotected and un-throttled, 
the Introspection Endpoint could present a means for an attacker 
to poll a series of possible token values, fishing for a valid token.  

Therefore, 
the Authorization Server SHOULD issue special client credentials 
to any protected resources or clients that need to access the introspection endpoint.  

These credentials may be used directly at the endpoint, 
or they may be exchanged for an OAuth2 Access token scoped specifically 
for the Introspection Endpoint.

Since the introspection endpoint takes in OAuth 2 tokens as parameters, 
it MUST be protected by TLS or equivalent.  
A server MAY require an HTTP POST method only to the endpoint.
