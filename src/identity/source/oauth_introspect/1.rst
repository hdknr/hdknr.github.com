1. Introduction
==============================

In OAuth, 
the contents of tokens are opaque to clients.  

This means that the :term:`client` does not need to know anything 
about the content or structure of the token itself, 
if there is any.  

However, there is
still a large amount of **metadata** that may be attached to a token,
such as its current validity, 
approved scopes, 
and extra information about the authentication context 
in which the token was issued.

.. note::
    - トークンは現在有効か？
    - 承認されたスコープは？
    - 認証コンテキスト詳細は？ 

These pieces of information are often vital to :term:`Protected Resources`
making authorization decisions 
based on the tokens being presented.
Since OAuth2 defines no direct relationship 
between the :term:`Authorization Server` and the :term:`Protected Resource`, 
only that they must have an agreement on the tokens themselves, 
there have been many different approaches to bridging this gap.

This specification defines an :term:`Introspection Endpoint` 
that allows the holder of a token 
to query the Authorization Server to discover the set of metadata for a token.  

A Protected Resource may use the mechanism described in this draft 
to query the Introspection Endpoint 
in a particular authorization decision context 
and ascertain the relevant metadata 
about the token in order to make this authorization decision appropriately.
