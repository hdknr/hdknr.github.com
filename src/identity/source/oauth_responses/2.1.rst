2.1.  Response Modes
------------------------------------

This specification defines the following OAuth Authorization Request parameter:

.. glossary::

    response_mode
        OPTIONAL. 

        Informs the Authorization Server of the mechanism 
        to be used for returning Authorization Response parameters 
        from the Authorization Endpoint. 

        This use of this parameter is NOT RECOMMENDED with a value 
        that specifies the same Response Mode as the default Response Mode 
        for the Response Type used.

This specification defines the following Response Modes, which are described with their response_mode parameter values:

.. glossary::

    query
        In this mode, 
        Authorization Response parameters are encoded in the :term:`query string` 
        added to the :term:`redirect_uri` when redirecting back to the Client.

        .. note::
            :doc:`OAuth 2.0 <oauth>` 的にはこれがデフォルト

    fragment
        In this mode, 
        Authorization Response parameters are encoded in the :term:`fragment` 
        added to the redirect_uri when redirecting back to the Client.

For purposes of this specification, 
the default Response Mode for the OAuth 2.0 code Response Type is the query encoding. 
For purposes of this specification, the default Response Mode for the OAuth 2.0 token Response Type is the fragment encoding.

See :doc:`OAuth 2.0 Form Post Response Mode <oauth_post>` :term:`[OAuth.Post]` 
for an example of a specification that defines an additional Response Mode. 

Note that it is expected that additional Response Modes may be defined by other specifications in the future, 
including possibly ones utilizing the :term:`HTML5 postMessage API` and :term:`Cross Origin Resource Sharing` (CORS).
