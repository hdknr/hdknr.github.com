------------------------

This specification uses the terms 
:term:`Access Token`, 
:term:`Refresh Token`, 
:term:`Authorization Code`,
:term:`Authorization Grant`,
:term:`Authorization Server`,
:term:`Authorization Endpoint`,
:term:`Client`,
:term:`Client Identifier`,
:term:`Client Secret`,
:term:`Protected Resource`,
:term:`Resource Owner`,
:term:`Resource Server`, and 
:term:`Token Endpoint` 
defined by OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0]. This specification also defines the following terms:

.. glossary::

    Client and Server
        In the traditional client-server authentication model, 
        the :term:`client` requests an access restricted resource (:term:`Protected Resource`) 
        on the server by authenticating with the server using the :term:`Resource Owner`'s credentials. 

    Authorization Endpoint
        A web resource maintained by the server, 
        and used to obtain authorization (grant) 
        from the :term:`Resource Owner` via :term:`User-Agent` redirection. 

    Response Type
        The :term:`Client` informs the :term:`Authorization Server` 
        of the desired authorization processing flow using the parameter :term:`response_type`. 

    Authorization Endpoint Response Type Registry
        Process established by the OAuth 2.0 specification 
        for the registration of new :term:`response_type` parameters. 

    Multiple-Valued Response Types
        The OAuth 2.0 specification allows for registration of space-separated :term:`response_type` values. 
        If a response type contains one of more space characters (%20), 
        it is compared as a space-delimited list of values in which the order of values does not matter.
