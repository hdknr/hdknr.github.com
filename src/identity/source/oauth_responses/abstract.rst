Abstract
===========

This specification aims to provide guidance on proper encoding of responses 
to OAuth 2.0 :term:`Authorization requests`, 
where the request specifies a :term:`response type` that includes space characters.

This specification also serves as the registration document 
for several specific new :term:`response types`, 
in accordance with the stipulations [#]_ of the :term:`OAuth Parameters Registry`.
