This specification provides **guidance** on the proper encoding of responses 
to OAuth 2.0 :ref:`Authorization Requests` in which 
the request uses a :term:`Response Type` value that includes space characters. 

Furthermore, 
this specification registers several new Response Type values 
in the :term:`OAuth Authorization Endpoint Response Types` registry.


This specification also defines a :ref:`Response Mode` Authorization Request parameter 
that informs the Authorization Server of the mechanism to be used 
for returning Authorization Response parameters 
from the Authorization Endpoint.
