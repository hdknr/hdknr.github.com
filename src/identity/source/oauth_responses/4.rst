4.  None Response Type
============================================

This section registers the response type :term:`none`, 
in accordance with the stipulations in :ref:`the OAuth 2.0 specification, Section 8.4 <oauth_8_4>`. 
The intended purpose is to enable use cases 
where a party requests the :term:`server` to register a grant of access to a :term:`Protected Resource` 
on behalf of a :term:`Client` 
but requires no access credentials to be returned to the Client at that time. 
The means by which the Client eventually obtains the access credentials is left unspecified here.

One scenario is 
where a user wishes to purchase an application from a market, 
and desires to authorize application installation 
and grant the application access to Protected Resources in a single step. 
However, 
since the user is not presently interacting with the (not yet active) application, 
it is not appropriate to return access credentials simultaneously in the authorization step.

    none
        When supplied as the :term:`response_type` parameter in an OAuth 2.0 :term:`authorization request`, 
        the :term:`Authorization Server` SHOULD NOT return an OAuth 2.0 :term:`code` nor a :term:`token` 
        in a successful response to the :term:`grant request`. 
        If a :term:`redirect_uri` is supplied, 
        the :term:`User-Agent` SHOULD be redirected there 
        after granting or denying access. 
        The request MAY include a :term:`state` parameter, 
        and if so the :term:`server` MUST echo its value by adding it to the :term:`redirect_uri`
        when issuing a successful response. 
        Any parameters added to the :term:`redirect_uri` should be query encoded. 
        This applies to both successful responses and error responses.

The response type :term:`none` SHOULD NOT be combined with other response types.
