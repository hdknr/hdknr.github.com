====================================================================================

This section registers combinations of the values code, token, and id_token, which are each individually registered response types.

    code token
        When supplied as the value for the response_type parameter, a successful response MUST include both an Access Token and an Authorization Code as defined in the OAuth 2.0 specification. Both successful and error responses SHOULD be fragment-encoded. 

    code id_token
        When supplied as the value for the response_type parameter, a successful response MUST include both an Authorization Code as well as an id_token. Both success and error responses SHOULD be fragment-encoded. 

    id_token token
        When supplied as the value for the response_type parameter, a successful response MUST include both an Access Token as well as an id_token. Both success and error responses SHOULD be fragment-encoded. 

    code id_token token
        When supplied as the value for the response_type parameter, a successful response MUST include an Authorization Code, an id_token, and an Access Token. Both success and error responses SHOULD be fragment-encoded. 

A non-normative request/response example as issued/received by the User-Agent:

::

   GET https://server.example.com/authorize?
   response_type=token%20id_token
   &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
   &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.com%2Fcb
   &state=af0ifjsldkj HTTP/1.1
   
   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Location: https://client.example.com/cb#
   access_token=SlAV32hkKG
   &token_type=bearer
   &id_token=1234567.SlAV32hkKG.abcde1234
   &expires_in=3600
