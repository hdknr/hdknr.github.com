2.2.  Multiple-Valued Response Types
----------------------------------------------------

When a multiple-valued Response Type is defined, 
it is RECOMMENDED that the following encoding rules be applied 
for the issued response from the Authorization Endpoint.

All parameters returned from the Authorization Endpoint 
SHOULD use the same Response Mode. 

This recommendation applies to both success and error responses.



Rationale: 
    This significantly simplifies Client parameter processing. 

    It also can have positive performance benefits, as described below.


For instance, 
if a response includes fragment encoded parts, 
a User Agent Client component must be involved to complete processing of the response. 

If a new query parameter is added to the Client URI, 
it will cause the User Agent to re-fetch the Client URI, 
causing discontinuity of operation of the User Agent based Client components. 

If only fragment encoding is used, 
the User Agent will simply reactivate the Client component, 
which can then process the fragment 
and also convey any parameters to a Client host as necessary, 
e.g., via XmlHttpRequest. 

Therefore, 
full fragment encoding always results in lower latency for response processing.
