2.  Response Types and Response Modes
==========================================

The Response Type request parameter :term:`response_type` informs 
the Authorization Server of the desired authorization processing flow, 
including what parameters are returned from the endpoints used. 

The Response Mode request parameter :term:`response_mode` 
informs the Authorization Server of the mechanism 
to be used for returning Authorization Response parameters 
from the Authorization Endpoint. 

Each Response Type value also defines a default Response Mode mechanism to be used, 
if no Response Mode is specified using the request parameter.
