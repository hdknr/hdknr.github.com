2.  Encoding Multiple-Valued Response Types
======================================================

This specification does not provide guidance 
if, in a request, :term:`response_type` includes a value 
that requires the server to return data partially encoded 
in the :term:`query string` and partially encoded in the :term:`fragment`.

Otherwise, 
if a multiple-valued response type is defined, 
then it is RECOMMENDED that the following encoding rules be applied for the issued response.

If, in a request, :term:`response_type` includes **only values** 
that require the :term:`server` to return data fully encoded within the :term:`query string` 
then the returned data in the response for this multiple-valued :term:`response_type` 
MUST be fully encoded within the :term:`query string`. 
This recommendation applies to both success and error responses.

If, in a request, :term:`response_type` includes **any value** 
that requires the :term:`server` to return data fully encoded 
within the :term:`fragment`
then the returned data in the response for this multiple-valued :term:`response_type`
MUST be fully encoded within the :term:`fragment`. 
This recommendation applies to both success and error responses.

Rationale [#]_ : 
Whenever :term:`response_type` values include :term:`fragment-encoded parts`, 
a :term:`User-Agent Client` component must be involved to complete processing of the response. 
If a new :term:`query parameter` is added to the :term:`Client URI`, 
it will cause the :term:`User-Agent` to re-fetch the :term:`Client URI`, 
causing discontinuity of operation of the :term:`User-Agent` based :term:`Client components`. 
If only :term:`fragment encoding` is used, 
the :term:`User-Agent` will simply reactivate the :term:`Client component` 
which may then process the :term:`fragment` and also convey any parameters to a :term:`Client host` as necessary, 
e.g., via :term:`XmlHttpRequest`. 
Therefore, 
full :term:`fragment encoding` always results in lower latency for response processing.
