3.  ID Token Response Type
========================================

This section registers a new response type, the :term:`id_token`, 
in accordance with the stipulations in the :ref:`OAuth 2.0 specification, Section 8.4 <oauth_8_4>`. 

The intended purpose of the :term:`id_token` is that 
it MUST provide **an assertion of the identity** of the :term:`Resource Owner` 
as understood by the :term:`server`. 
The assertion MUST specify a targeted :term:`audience`, e.g. the requesting :term:`Client`. 
However, 
the specific semantics of the assertion and how it can be validated are not specified in this document.

.. glossary::

    id_token
        If supplied as the :term:`response_type` parameter 
        in an OAuth 2.0 :term:`Authorization Request`, 
        a successful response should include the parameter :term:`id_token` encoded 
        in the :term:`fragment` of the :term:`response URI`. 

Returning the :term:`id_token` in a :term:`fragment` reduces the likelihood 
that the :term:`id_token` leaks during transport 
and mitigates the associated risks to the privacy of the user (:term:`Resource Owner`).
