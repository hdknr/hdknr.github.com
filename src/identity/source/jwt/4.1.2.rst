4.1.2. "nbf" (Not Before) Claim
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The "nbf" (not before) claim identifies the time before which the
token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  The processing of the
"nbf" claim requires that the current date/time MUST be after or
equal to the not-before date/time listed in the "nbf" claim.
Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than
a few minutes, to account for clock skew.  Its value MUST be a number
containing an :term:`IntDate` value.  

This claim is OPTIONAL.
