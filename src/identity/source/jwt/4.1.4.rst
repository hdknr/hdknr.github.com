4.1.4.  "exp" (Expiration Time) Claim
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "exp" (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on
or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  The
processing of the "exp" claim requires that the current date/time
MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the "exp" claim.
Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than
a few minutes, to account for clock skew.  Its value MUST be a number
containing an IntDate value.  Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.
