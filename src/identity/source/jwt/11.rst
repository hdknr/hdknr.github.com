11.  Security Considerations
===================================

All of the security issues that are pertinent to any cryptographic
application must be addressed by JWT/JWS/JWE/JWK agents.  Among these
issues are protecting the user's asymmetric private and symmetric
secret keys, preventing various attacks, and helping avoid mistakes
such as inadvertently encrypting a message to the wrong recipient.
The entire list of security considerations is beyond the scope of
this document, but some significant considerations are listed here.


All the security considerations in the JWS specification also apply
to JWT, as do the JWE security considerations when encryption is
employed.  In particular, the JWS JSON Security Considerations and
Unicode Comparison Security Considerations apply equally to the JWT
Claims Set in the same manner that they do to the JOSE Header.
