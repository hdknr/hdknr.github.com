11.  Security Considerations
===================================

All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
must be faced by a JWT/JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  

Among these issues are protecting the user's asymmetric private 
and symmetric secret keys,
preventing various attacks, and helping avoid mistakes such as
inadvertently encrypting a message to the wrong recipient.  The
entire list of security considerations is beyond the scope of this
document.

All the security considerations in the JWS specification also apply
to JWT, as do the JWE security considerations when encryption is
employed.  In particular, the JWS JSON Security Considerations and
Unicode Comparison Security Considerations apply equally to the JWT
Claims Set in the same manner that they do to the JWS Header.
