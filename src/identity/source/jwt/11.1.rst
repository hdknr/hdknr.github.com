11.1.  Trust Decisions
---------------------------------

The contents of a JWT cannot be relied upon in a trust decision
unless its contents have been cryptographically secured 
and bound to the context necessary for the trust decision.  

In particular, 
the key(s) used to sign and/or encrypt the JWT will typically need to
verifiably be under the control of the party identified 
as the issuer of the JWT.
