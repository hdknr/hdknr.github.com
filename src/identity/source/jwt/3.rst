3.  JSON Web Token (JWT) Overview
============================================

JWTs represent a set of claims 
as a JSON object that is encoded in a JWS and/or JWE structure.  

This JSON object is the :term:`JWT Claims Set`. 

As per Section 4 of [RFC7159], 
the JSON object consists of zero or more name/value pairs (or members), 
where the names are strings and the values are arbitrary JSON values.  

These members are the claims represented by the JWT.


The member names within the JWT Claims Set 
are referred to as :term:`Claim Names`.  

The corresponding values are referred to as :term:`Claim Values`.


The contents of the :term:`JWT Header` describe 
the cryptographic operations applied to the JWT Claims Set. 

If the JWT Header is a JWS Header, 
the JWT is represented as a JWS, 
and the claims are digitally signed or MACed, 
with the JWT Claims Set being the JWS Payload.  

If the JWT Header is a JWE Header, 
the JWT is represented as a JWE, 
and the claims are encrypted, 
with the JWT Claims Set being the input Plaintext.  

A JWT may be enclosed in another JWE or JWS structure to create a :term:`Nested JWT`, 
enabling nested signing and encryption to be performed.


A JWT is represented as a sequence of URL-safe parts 
separated by period ('.') characters.  

Each part contains a base64url encoded value.  

The number of parts in the JWT is dependent 
upon the representation of the resulting JWS or JWE object 
using the JWS Compact Serialization or the JWE Compact Serialization.
