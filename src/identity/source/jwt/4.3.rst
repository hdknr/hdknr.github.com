4.3.  Private Claim Names
---------------------------

A producer and consumer of a JWT MAY agree to use Claim Names that
are Private Names: names that are not Registered Claim Names
Section 4.1 or Public Claim Names Section 4.2.  Unlike Public Claim
Names, Private Claim Names are subject to collision and should be
used with caution.
