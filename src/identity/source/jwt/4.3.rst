4.3.  Private Claim Names
---------------------------

A producer and consumer of a JWT may agree to any claim name that is not a :ref:`Reserved Name Section 4.1  <jwt.4.1>` or 
a :ref:`Public Name Section 4.2 <jwt.4.2>`. 
Unlike Public Names, 
these private names are subject to collision and should be used with caution.
