6.1.  Example Plaintext JWT
---------------------------------------------

The following example JWT Header declares that the encoded object is a Plaintext JWT:

:: 

    {"alg":"none"}

Base64url encoding the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JWT Header yields this Encoded JWT Header:

::

    eyJhbGciOiJub25lIn0

The following is an example of a JWT Claims Object:

:: 

    {"iss":"joe",
    "exp":1300819380,
    "http://example.com/is_root":true}

Base64url encoding the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JSON Claims Object yields 
this Encoded JWS Payload, which is used as the JWT Second Part:

::

    eyJpc3MiOiJqb2UiLA0KICJleHAiOjEzMDA4MTkzODAsDQogImh0dHA6Ly9leGFtcGxlLmNvbS9pc19yb290Ijp0cnVlfQ

The JWT Third Part is the empty string.

Concatenating these parts in the order Header.Second.Third with period characters between the parts yields this complete JWT (with line breaks for display purposes only):

:: 

    eyJhbGciOiJub25lIn0
    .
    eyJpc3MiOiJqb2UiLA0KICJleHAiOjEzMDA4MTkzODAsDQogImh0dHA6Ly9leGFtcGxlLmNvbS9pc19yb290Ijp0cnVlfQ
    .
