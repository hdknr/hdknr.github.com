5.3.  Replicating Claims as Header Parameters
------------------------------------------------

In some applications using encrypted JWTs, it is useful to have an
unencrypted representation of some Claims.  This might be used, for
instance, in application processing rules to determine whether and
how to process the JWT before it is decrypted.

This specification allows Claims present in the JWT Claims Set to be
replicated as Header Parameters in a JWT that is a JWE, as needed by
the application.  If such replicated Claims are present, the
application receiving them SHOULD verify that their values are
identical.  It is the responsibility of the application to ensure
that only claims that are safe to be transmitted in an unencrypted
manner are replicated as Header Parameter Values in the JWT.

This specification registers the "iss" (issuer), "sub" (subject), and
"aud" (audience) Header Parameter Names for the purpose of providing
unencrypted replicas of these Claims in encrypted JWTs for
applications that need them.  Other specifications MAY similarly
register other names that are registered Claim Names as Header
Parameter Names, as needed.
