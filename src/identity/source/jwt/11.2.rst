11.2.  Signing and Encryption Order
----------------------------------------------------

While syntactically, 
the signing and encryption operations 
for Nested JWTs may be applied in any order, 
normally senders should sign the message 
and then encrypt the result (thus encrypting the signature).

This prevents attacks in which the signature is stripped, 
leaving just an encrypted message, 
as well as providing privacy for the
signer.  

Furthermore, 
signatures over encrypted text are not considered valid 
in many jurisdictions.

Note that potential concerns about security issues 
related to the order of signing and encryption operations 
are already addressed by the underlying JWS and JWE specifications; 
in particular, 
because JWE only supports the use of authenticated encryption algorithms,
cryptographic concerns about the potential need to sign 
after encryption that apply in many contexts 
do not apply to this specification.
