5.  JOSE Header
============================

For a JWT object, the members of the JSON object represented by the
JOSE Header describe the cryptographic operations applied to the JWT
and optionally, additional properties of the JWT.  Depending upon
whether the JWT is a JWS or JWE, the corresponding rules for the JOSE
Header values apply.

This specification further specifies the use of the following Header
Parameters in both the cases where the JWT is a JWS and where it is a
JWE.
