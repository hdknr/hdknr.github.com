5.  JWT Header
============================

The members of the JSON object represented by the JWT Header describe
the cryptographic operations applied to the JWT and optionally,
additional properties of the JWT.  The member names within the JWT
Header are referred to as Header Parameter Names.  These names MUST
be unique; recipients MUST either reject JWTs with duplicate Header
Parameter Names or use a JSON parser that returns only the lexically
last duplicate member name, as specified in Section 15.12 (The JSON
Object) of ECMAScript 5.1 [ECMAScript].  The corresponding values are
referred to as Header Parameter Values.

JWS Header Parameters are defined by [JWS].  JWE Header Parameters
are defined by [JWE].  This specification further specifies the use
of the following Header Parameter in both the cases where the JWT is
a JWS and where it is a JWE.
