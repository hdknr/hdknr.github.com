4.1.5.  "nbf" (Not Before) Claim
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "nbf" (not before) claim identifies the time before which the JWT
MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  The processing of the "nbf"
claim requires that the current date/time MUST be after or equal to
the not-before date/time listed in the "nbf" claim.  Implementers MAY
provide for some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to
account for clock skew.  Its value MUST be a number containing an
IntDate value.  Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.
