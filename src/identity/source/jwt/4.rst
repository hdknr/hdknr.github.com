4.  JWT Claims
===========================

A JWT contains a set of :term::`claims` represented as a :term:`base64url` encoded JSON object. 
Note however, 
that the set of claims a JWT must contain to be considered valid is context-dependent 
and is outside the scope of this specification. 
When used in a security-related context, 
implementations MUST understand and support all of the claims present; 
otherwise, the JWT MUST be rejected for processing.

There are three classes of JWT Claim Names: 
:ref:`Reserved Claim Names <jwt.4.1>`, 
:ref:`Public Claim Names <jwt.4.2>`, and 
:ref:`Private Claim Names <jwt.4.3>`.
