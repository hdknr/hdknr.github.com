4.  JWT Claims
===========================

The JWT Claims Set represents 
a JSON object whose members are the claims conveyed by the JWT.  

The Claim Names within a JWT Claims Set MUST be unique; 
recipients MUST either reject JWTs with duplicate Claim Names 
or use a JSON parser that returns only the lexically last
duplicate member name, 
as specified in Section 15.12 (The JSON Object) of 
ECMAScript 5.1 :term:`[ECMAScript]`.


The set of claims that a JWT must contain to be considered valid 
is **context-dependent** and is outside the scope of this specification.

Specific applications of JWTs will require implementations 
to understand and process some claims in particular ways.  

However, 
in the absence of such requirements, 
all claims that are not understood by implementations SHOULD be ignored.

There are three classes of JWT Claim Names: Registered Claim Names,
Public Claim Names, and Private Claim Names.
