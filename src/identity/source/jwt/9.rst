9.  IANA Considerations
=================================

This specification calls for:

    A new IANA registry entitled "JSON Web Token Claims" for reserved claim names is defined in :ref:`Section 4.1 <jwt.4.1>`. 
    Inclusion in the registry is RFC Required in the RFC 5226 [:rfc:`5226`] sense for reserved JWT claim names 
    that are intended to be interoperable between implementations. 

    The registry will just record the reserved claim name and a pointer to the RFC that defines it. 
    This specification defines inclusion of the claim names defined in :ref:`Table 1 <jwt.table.1>`.
