1.  Introduction
===========================

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact token format intended for space constrained environments 
such as HTTP :term:`Authorization headers` and :term:`URI query parameters`. 
JWTs encode :term:`claims` to be transmitted as a :term:`JSON` object (as defined in RFC 4627 [:rfc:`4627`]) 
that is :term:`base64url` encoded and digitally signed and/or encrypted. 
Signing is accomplished using JSON Web Signature (JWS) [:term::`JWS`]. 
Encryption is accomplished using JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [:term:`JWE`].

The suggested pronunciation of JWT is the same as the English word "jot".
