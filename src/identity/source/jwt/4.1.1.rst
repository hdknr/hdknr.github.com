4.1.1. "exp" (Expiration Time) Claim
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The "exp" (**expiration time**) claim identifies 
the expiration time on or after which the token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  
The processing of the "exp" claim requires that the current date/time
MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the "exp" claim.

Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, 
usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew.  
Its value MUST be a number containing an :term:`IntDate` value.  

This claim is OPTIONAL.
