8.  Cryptographic Algorithms
====================================

JWTs use JSON Web Signature (JWS) [:term:`JWS`] and 
JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [:term:`JWE`] to sign and/or encrypt the contents of the JWT.

Of the JWS signing algorithms, 
only HMAC SHA-256 MUST be implemented by conforming JWT implementations. 
It is RECOMMENDED that implementations also support the RSA SHA-256 and ECDSA P-256 SHA-256 algorithms. 
Support for other algorithms and key sizes is OPTIONAL.

If an implementation provides encryption capabilities, 
of the JWE encryption algorithms, 
only RSA-PKCS1-1.5 with 2048 bit keys, 
AES-128-CBC, and 
AES-256-CBC 
MUST be implemented by conforming implementations. 

It is RECOMMENDED that implementations also support 
ECDH-ES with 256 bit keys, 
AES-128-GCM, and 
AES-256-GCM. 

Support for other algorithms and key sizes is OPTIONAL.
