2.  Terminology
=====================

.. glossary::

    JSON Web Token (JWT)
        A string consisting of three parts: 
        the :term:`JWT Header`, 
        the :term:`JWT Second Part`, and 
        the :term:`JWT Third Part`, in that order, 
        with the parts being separated by **period** ('.') characters, 
        and each part containing :term:`base64url` encoded content.

    JWT Header
        A string containing a JSON object that describes the **cryptographic operations** applied to the JWT. 
        When the JWT is signed, the JWT Header is the :term:`JWS Header`. 
        When the JWT is encrypted, the JWT Header is the :term:`JWE Header`.

    JWT Second Part
        When the JWT is signed, the JWT Second Part is the :term:`Encoded JWS Payload`. 
        When the JWT is encrypted, the JWT Second Part is the :term:`Encoded JWE Encrypted Key`.

    JWT Third Part
        When the JWT is signed, the JWT Third Part is the :term:`Encoded JWS Signature`. 
        When the JWT is encrypted, the JWT Third Part is the :term:`Encoded JWE Ciphertext`.

    JWT Claims Object
        A JSON object that represents the claims contained in the JWT. 
        When the JWT is signed, the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JWT Claims Object are base64url encoded 
        to create the :term:`Encoded JWS Payload`. 
        When the JWT is encrypted, the bytes of the UTF-8 representation of the JWT Claims Object are used as the :term:`JWE Plaintext`.

    Claim Names
        The names of the members of the JWT Claims Object.

    Claim Values
        The values of the members of the JWT Claims Object.

    Encoded JWT Header
        Base64url encoding of the bytes of the UTF-8 RFC 3629 [:rfc:`3629`] representation of the :term:`JWT Header`.

    Base64url Encoding
        For the purposes of this specification, 
        this term always refers to the URL- and filename-safe Base64 encoding described in RFC 4648 [:rfc:`4648`], Section 5, 
        with the (non URL-safe) '=' padding characters omitted, as permitted by Section 3.2. 
        (See Appendix C of [:term:`JWS`] for notes on implementing base64url encoding without padding.)
