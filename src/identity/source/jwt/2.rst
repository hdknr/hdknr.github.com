2.  Terminology
=====================

These terms defined by the JSON Web Signature (:doc:`JWS <jws>`) [JWS]    
specification are incorporated into this specification: "JSON Web    
Signature (JWS)", "Base64url Encoding", "Header Parameter", "JOSE    
Header", "JWS Compact Serialization", "JWS Payload", "JWS Signature",    
and "Plaintext JWS". 

These terms defined by the JSON Web Encryption (:doc:`JWE <jwe>`) [JWE]   
specification are incorporated into this specification: "JSON Web    
Encryption (JWE)", "Content Encryption Key (CEK)", "JWE Compact  
Serialization", "JWE Encrypted Key", "JWE Initialization Vector",    
"JWE Plaintext". 

These terms are defined by this specification:

.. glossary::


   JSON Web Token (JWT)  
   JSON Web Token
   JWT
      A string representing a set of claims as a JSON object 
      that is encoded in a :doc:`JWS <jws>` or :doc:`JWE <jwe>`, 
      enabling the claims to be digitally signed or MACed and/or encrypted.

   Base64url Encoding  
      Base64 encoding using the URL- and filename-safe character set
      defined in Section 5 of :rfc:`4648` [RFC4648], 
      with all trailing '=' characters omitted
      (as permitted by :ref:`Section 3.2 <jwt.3.2>`) 
      and without the inclusion of any line breaks, white space, 
      or other additional characters.  

      (See :ref:`Appendix C <jws.appendix.c>` of [JWS] 
      for notes on implementing base64url encoding without padding.)

   JWT Header  
      A JSON object that describes the cryptographic operations 
      applied to the JWT.  

      When the JWT is digitally signed or MACed, 
      the JWT Header is a JWS Header.  

      When the JWT is encrypted, the JWT Header is a JWE Header.

   Header Parameter
      A name/value pair that is member of the JWT Header.

   Header Parameter Name
      The name of a member of the JWT Header.

   Header Parameter Value  
      The value of a member of the JSON object
      representing a JWT Header.

   JWT Claims Set  
      A JSON object that contains the Claims conveyed by the JWT.

   Claim
      A piece of information asserted about a subject.  

      A Claim is represented as a name/value pair 
      consisting of a Claim Name and a Claim Value.

   Claim Name  
      The name portion of a Claim representation.  

      A Claim Name is always a string.

   Claim Value  
      The value portion of a Claim representation.  

      A Claim Value can be any JSON value. 

   Encoded JWT Header  
      Base64url encoding of the JWT Header.

   Nested JWT
      A JWT in which nested signing and/or encryption are employed.  

      In nested JWTs, 
      a JWT is used as the payload or plaintext value of an
      enclosing JWS or JWE structure, respectively.

   Collision Resistant Namespace  
      A name in a namespace that enables names to be allocated 
      in a manner such that they are highly unlikely to collide 
      with other names.  

      Examples of collision-resistant namespaces include: 
      Domain Names, Object Identifiers (OIDs) as defined 
      in the ITU-T X.660 and X.670 Recommendation series, 
      and Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUIDs) :term:`[RFC4122]`.  

      When using an administratively delegated namespace, 
      the definer of a name needs to take reasonable
      precautions to ensure they are 
      in control of the portion of the namespace 
      they use to define the name.

   StringOrURI  
      A JSON string value, with the additional requirement
      that while arbitrary string values MAY be used, any value
      containing a ":" character MUST be a URI [RFC3986].  StringOrURI
      values are compared as case-sensitive strings with no
      transformations or canonicalizations applied.

   IntDate  
      A JSON numeric value representing the number of seconds from
      1970-01-01T0:0:0Z UTC until the specified UTC date/time.  

      See :rfc:`3339` :term:`[RFC3339]` for details regarding date/times 
      in general and UTC in particular.
