4.1.  Reserved Claim Names       
---------------------------------

The following claim names are reserved.  
None of the claims defined in the table below are intended to be mandatory, 
but rather, provide a starting point for a set of useful, interoperable claims.  
All the names are short because a core goal of JWTs is for the tokens to be compact.

.. _jwt.table.1:

.. list-table:: Table 1: Reserved Claim Definitions 

    *   - Claim Name  
        - JSON Value Type 
        - Claim Syntax    
        - Claim Semantics

    *   - exp 
        - number  
        - IntDate  
        -  The exp (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on or after which the token MUST NOT be accepted for processing. The processing of the exp claim requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the exp claim. Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. This claim is OPTIONAL.

    *   - nbf 
        - number  
        - IntDate  
        - The nbf (not before) claim identifies the time before which the token MUST NOT be accepted for processing. The processing of the nbf claim requires that the current date/time MUST be after or equal to the not-before date/time listed in the nbf claim. Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. This claim is OPTIONAL.

    *   - iat 
        - number  
        - IntDate  
        - The iat (issued at) claim identifies the time at which the JWT was issued. This claim can be used to determine the age of the token. This claim is OPTIONAL.

    *   - iss 
        - string  
        - StringOrURI  
        - The iss (issuer) claim identifies the principal that issued the JWT. The processing of this claim is generally application specific. The iss value is case sensitive. This claim is OPTIONAL.

    *   - aud 
        - string  
        - StringOrURI  
        - The aud (audience) claim identifies the audience that the JWT is intended for. The principal intended to process the JWT MUST be identified with the value of the audience claim. If the principal processing the claim does not identify itself with the identifier in the aud claim value then the JWT MUST be rejected. The interpretation of the audience value is generally application specific. The aud value is case sensitive. This claim is OPTIONAL.

    *   - prn 
        - string  
        - StringOrURI  
        - The prn (principal) claim identifies the subject of the JWT. The processing of this claim is generally application specific. The prn value is case sensitive. This claim is OPTIONAL.

    *   - jti 
        - string  
        - String   
        - The jti (JWT ID) claim provides a unique identifier for the JWT. The identifier value MUST be assigned in a manner that ensures that there is a negligible probability that the same value will be accidentally assigned to a different data object. The jti claim can be used to prevent the JWT from being replayed. The jti value is case sensitive. This claim is OPTIONAL.

    *   - typ 
        - string  
        - String   
        - The typ (type) claim is used to declare a type for the contents of this JWT Claims Set. The typ value is case sensitive. This claim is OPTIONAL.


Additional reserved claim names MAY be defined via the IANA JSON Web Token Claims registry, as per :ref:`Section 9 <jwt.9>`. 
The syntax values used above are defined as follows:

.. _jwt.table.2:

.. list-table:: Table 2: Claim Syntax Definitions 

    *   - Syntax Name 
        - Syntax Definition

    *   - IntDate  
        - The number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the desired date/time. See RFC 3339 [RFC3339] for details regarding date/times in general and UTC in particular.
    
    *   - String   
        - Any string value MAY be used.

    *   - StringOrURI  
        - Any string value MAY be used but a value containing a ":" character MUST be a URI as defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].
