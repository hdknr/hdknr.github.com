6.  Plaintext JWTs
==============================

To support use cases 
where the JWT content is secured 
by a means other than a signature and/or encryption 
contained within the JWT 
(such as a signature on a data structure containing the JWT), 
JWTs MAY also be created without a signature or encryption.  

A plaintext JWT is a JWS 
using the "**none**" JWS ":ref:`alg <jws.alg>`" Header Parameter Value
defined in JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) :term:`[JWA]`; 
it is a JWS with the empty string for its JWS Signature value.
