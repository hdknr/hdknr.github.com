6.  Plaintext JWTs
==============================

To support use cases where the JWT content is secured by a means other 
than a signature and/or encryption contained within the token 
(such as a signature on a data structure containing the token), 
JWTs MAY also be created without a signature or encryption. 

Plaintext JWTs MUST use the :term:`alg` value **none**, and are formatted identically to a signed JWT 
with an empty signature. 
This means that 
the :term:`base64url encoding` of the bytes representing the UTF-8 encoding of the :term:`JWT Claims Object` 
is the :term:`JWT Second Part`, and the empty string is the :term:`JWT Third Part`.
