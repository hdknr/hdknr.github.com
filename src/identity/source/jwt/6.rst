6.  Plaintext JWTs
==============================

To support use cases where the JWT content is secured by a means
other than a signature and/or encryption contained within the JWT
(such as a signature on a data structure containing the JWT), 
JWTs MAY also be created without a signature or encryption.  

A plaintext
JWT is a JWS using the "alg" Header Parameter value "none" and with
the empty string for its JWS Signature value, as defined in JSON Web
Algorithms (JWA) [JWA]; it is a Plaintext JWS with the JWT Claims Set
as its JWS Payload.
