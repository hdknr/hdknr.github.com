4.1.3.  "aud" (Audience) Claim
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The "aud" (audience) claim identifies the audiences 
that the JWT is intended for.  

Each principal intended to process the JWT MUST
identify itself with a value in audience claim.  

If the principal processing the claim does not identify itself 
with a value in the "aud" claim, 
then the JWT MUST be rejected.  

In the general case, 
the "aud" value is an array of case-sensitive strings, 
each containing a StringOrURI value.  

In the special case when the JWT has one audience, 
the "aud" value MAY be a single case-sensitive string
containing a StringOrURI value.  

The interpretation of audience values is generally application specific.  

Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.
