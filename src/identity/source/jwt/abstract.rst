Abstract
============================================================

JSON Web Token (JWT) is 
a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.  
The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object 
that is used as the **payload** of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or 
as the **plaintext** of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, 
enabling the claims to be digitally signed or MACed and/or encrypted.

The suggested pronunciation of JWT is the same as the English word "jot".
