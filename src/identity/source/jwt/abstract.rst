Abstract
===============

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a means of representing :term:`claims` to be transferred between two parties.  
The claims in a JWT are encoded as a :term:`JSON` object 
that is digitally signed using :doc:`JSON Web Signature (JWS) <jws>`
and/or encrypted using :doc:`JSON Web Encryption (JWE) <jwe>`.

The suggested pronunciation of JWT is the same as the English word "jot".
