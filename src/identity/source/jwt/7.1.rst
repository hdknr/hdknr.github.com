7.1.  String Comparison Rules
--------------------------------------------------------

Processing a JWT inevitably requires comparing known strings to
values in JSON objects.  For example, in checking what the algorithm
is, the Unicode string encoding "alg" will be checked against the
member names in the JOSE Header to see if there is a matching Header
Parameter name.

Comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings MUST be
performed by comparing Unicode code points without normalization, as
specified in the String Comparison Rules in Section 5.3 of [JWS].
