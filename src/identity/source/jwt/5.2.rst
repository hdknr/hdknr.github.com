5.2.  "cty" (Content Type) Header Parameter
---------------------------------------------------

The "cty" (content type) Header Parameter 
defined by [JWS] and [JWE] is used by this specification 
to convey structural information about the JWT.

In the normal case where nested signing or encryption operations 
are not employed, 
the use of this Header Parameter is NOT RECOMMENDED.

In the case that nested signing or encryption is employed, 
this Header Parameter MUST be present; 
in this case, 
the value MUST be "**JWT**", 
to indicate that a Nested JWT is carried in this JWT.  

While media type names are not case-sensitive, 
it is RECOMMENDED that "JWT" always be spelled 
using uppercase characters for compatibility with
legacy implementations.  

See Appendix A.2 for an example of a Nested JWT.
