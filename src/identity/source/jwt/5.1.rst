5.1.  "typ" (Type) Header Parameter
---------------------------------------------

The "typ" (type) Header Parameter defined by [JWS] and [JWE] is used
to declare the MIME Media Type [IANA.MediaTypes] of this complete JWT
in contexts where this is useful to the application.  This parameter
has no effect upon the JWT processing.  

If present, it is RECOMMENDED that 
its value be "**JWT**" to indicate that this object is a JWT.  

While media type names are not case-sensitive, 
it is RECOMMENDED that "JWT" always be spelled using uppercase characters 
for compatibility with legacy implementations.  

Use of this Header Parameter is OPTIONAL.
