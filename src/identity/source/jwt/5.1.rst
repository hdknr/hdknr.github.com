5.1.  "typ" (Type) Header Parameter
---------------------------------------------

The "typ" (type) Header Parameter 
defined by [JWS] and [JWE] is used by JWT applications 
to declare the MIME Media Type [IANA.MediaTypes] of this complete JWT.  

This is intended for use by the JWT application 
when values that are not JWTs could also be present 
in an application data structure that can contain a JWT object; 
the application can use this value to disambiguate 
among the different kinds of objects that might be present.  

It will typically not be used by applications 
when it is already known that the object is a JWT.  

This parameter has no effect upon the JWT processing.  
If present, 
it is RECOMMENDED that its value be "JWT" to indicate that
this object is a JWT.  

While media type names are not case-sensitive,
it is RECOMMENDED that "JWT" always be spelled using uppercase
characters for compatibility with legacy implementations.  

Use of this Header Parameter is OPTIONAL.
