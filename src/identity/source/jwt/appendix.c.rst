Appendix C.  Acknowledgements
============================================

The authors acknowledge that 
the design of JWTs was intentionally influenced by the design and simplicity of Simple Web Tokens [SWT] 
and ideas for JSON tokens that Dick Hardt discussed within the OpenID community.

Solutions for signing JSON content were previously explored by Magic Signatures [MagicSignatures], 
JSON Simple Sign [JSS], and Canvas Applications [CanvasApp], all of which influenced this draft.
