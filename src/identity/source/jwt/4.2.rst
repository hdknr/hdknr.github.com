4.2.  Public Claim Names
--------------------------------

Claim Names can be defined at will by those using JWTs.  

However, in
order to prevent collisions, any new Claim Name should either be
registered in the IANA JSON Web Token Claims registry defined in
Section 10.1 or be a Public Name: a value that contains a Collision-
Resistant Name.  

In each case, the definer of the name or value needs
to take reasonable precautions to make sure they are in control of
the part of the namespace they use to define the Claim Name.
