4.2.  Public Claim Names
--------------------------------

Claim names can be defined at will by those using JWTs. 
However, 
in order to prevent collisions, 
any new claim name SHOULD either be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Claims registry or 
be defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace. 
Examples of collision resistant namespaces include:

    - Domain Names,
    - Object Identifiers (OIDs) as defined in the ITU-T X 660 and X 670 Recommendation series or
    - Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) as defined in RFC 4122 [RFC4122].

In each case, 
the definer of the name or value MUST take reasonable precautions to make sure 
they are in control of the part of the namespace they use to define the claim name.
