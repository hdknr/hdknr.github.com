1.2. Terminology
------------------------


This specification introduces the following new terms and
enhancements of OAuth term definitions.

.. glossary::

   resource set  
         One or more resources that the resource server manages as a set.

   scope type  
         A bounded extent of access that is possible to perform on a resource set.  
         In authorization policy terminology, 
         a scope type is one of the potentially many "**verbs**" 
         that can logically apply to a resource set ("**object**").  

         This specification extends the OAuth concept of a "scope" 
         by defining scope types as applying to particular labeled resource sets, 
         rather than leaving the relevant resources 
         (such as API endpoints or URIs) implicit.  

         A resource set can have any number of scope types,
         which together describe the universe of actions that **can be**
         taken on this protected resource set.  

         For example, 
         a resource set representing a status update API might have scope types
         that include adding an update or reading updates.  
         A resource set representing a photo album might have scope types that
         include viewing a slideshow or printing the album.  

         The resource server registers resource sets and their scope types
         when there is not yet any particular client in the picture.

   resource set registration endpoint  
         The endpoint at which the resource server registers resource sets 
         it wants the authorization server to know about.  

         The operations available at this endpoint constitute 
         a resource set registration API
         (see :ref:`Section 2.3 <oauth_res_reg>`).
