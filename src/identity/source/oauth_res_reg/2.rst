2. Resource Set Registration
==================================

This specification defines a :term:`resource set registration API`.  
If this API is not open, it MUST be **OAuth-protected**.  

For any of the resource owner's sets of resources 
this authorization server needs to be aware of, 
the resource server MUST register these resource sets 
at the authorization server's registration endpoint.
