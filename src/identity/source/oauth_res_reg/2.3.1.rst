2.3.1. Create Resource Set Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Adds a new resource set description using the PUT method, 
thereby putting it under the authorization server's protection.  
If the request is successful, 
the authorization server MUST respond with a status message 
that includes an ETag header and _id and _rev properties 
for managing resource set description versioning.

Form of a "create resource set description" HTTP request:

::

   PUT /resource_set/{rsid} HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/intro-resource-set+json
   ...

   (body contains JSON resource set description to be created)


Form of a successful HTTP response:

::

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Content-Type: application/intro-status+json
   ETag: (matches "_rev" property in returned object)
   ...

   {
     "status": "created",
     "_id": (id of created resource set),
     "_rev": (ETag of created resource set)
   }

On successful registration, 
the authorization server MAY return a redirect :term:`policy URI` to the resource server 
in a property with the name ":term:`policy_uri`".  

This URI allows the resource server to redirect the user 
to a specific user interface 
within the authorization server 
where the user can immediately set or modify access policies 
for the resource set that was just registered.

Form of a successful HTTP response:

::

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Content-Type: application/intro-status+json
   ETag: (matches "_rev" property in returned object)
   ...

   {
     "status": "created",
     "_id": (id of created resource set),
     "_rev": (ETag of created resource set)
     "policy_uri":"http://as.example.com/rs/222/resource/333/policy"
   }
