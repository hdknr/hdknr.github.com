2.3.4. Delete Resource Set Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Deletes a previously registered resource set description using the
DELETE method, thereby removing it from the authorization server's
protection regime.

Form of a "delete resource set description" HTTP request:

::

   DELETE /resource_set/{rsid}
   If-Match: (entity tag of resource)
   ...

Form of a successful HTTP response:

   HTTP/1.1 204 No content
   ...

As defined in Section 2.3, if the referenced resource does not exist
the authorization server MUST produce an error response with an error
property value of "not_found", and if the entity tag does not match
the authorization server MUST produce an error response with an error
property value of "precondition_failed".
