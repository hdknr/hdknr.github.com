2.2. Resource Set Descriptions
------------------------------------------

The resource server defines a resource set that 
the :term:`authorization server` needs to be aware of 
by registering a :term:`resource set` description at the authorization server.

A resource set description is a JSON document with the following properties:

.. glossary::

   name  
      REQUIRED.  

      A human-readable string describing a set of one or more resources.  
      The authorization server SHOULD use the name in
      its user interface to assist the user in setting policies for
      protecting this resource set.

   icon_uri  
      OPTIONAL.  

      A URI for a graphic icon representing the resource set.

   scopes  
      REQUIRED.  

      An array providing the URI references of :term:`scope type` descriptions 
      that are available for this resource set.

   type  
      OPTIONAL.  

      A string uniquely identifying the semantics of the
      :term:`resource set`.  

      For example, 
      if the resource set consists of a single resource that is an identity claim 
      that leverages standardized claim semantics, 
      the value of this property could be an identifying URI for this claim.

For example, 
this description characterizes a resource set (a photo album) 
that can potentially be only viewed, 
or alternatively to which full access can be granted; 
the URIs point to scope descriptions as defined in :ref:`Section 2.1 <oauth_res_reg.2.1>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "name": "Photo Album",
     "icon_uri": "http://www.example.com/icons/flower.png",
     "scopes": [
       "http://photoz.example.com/dev/scopes/view",
       "http://photoz.example.com/dev/scopes/all"
     ],
     "resource_set_type": "http://www.example.com/rsets/photoalbum"
   }

Resource set descriptions MAY contain extension properties that are
not defined in this specification.  
Extension names that are unprotected from collisions are 
outside the scope of the current specification.

When a resource server creates or updates a :term:`resource set` description
(see :ref:`Section 2.3 <oauth_res_reg.2.3>`), 
the authorization server MUST attempt to retrieve the referenced scope descriptions 
so that it can present fresh data in resource owner interactions.
