2.3.3. Update Resource Set Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Updates a previously registered resource set description using the
PUT method, thereby changing the resource set's protection
characteristics.  If the request is successful, the authorization
server MUST respond with a status message that includes an ETag
header and _id and _rev properties for managing resource set
description versioning.

Form of an "update resource set description" HTTfP request:

::

   PUT /resource_set/{rsid} HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/resource-set+json
   If-Match: (entity tag of resource)
   ...

   (body contains JSON resource set description to be updated)

Form of a successful HTTP response:

   HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
   ETag: "2"
   ...

If the entity tag does not match, the authorization server MUST
produce an error response with an error property value of
"precondition_failed", as defined in Section 2.3.

On successful update, the authorization server MAY return a redirect
policy URI to the resource server in a property with the name
"policy_uri".  This URI allows the resource server to redirect the
user to a specific user interface within the authorization server
where the user can immediately set or modify access policies for the
resource set that was just updated.
