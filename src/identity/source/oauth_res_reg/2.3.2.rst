2.3.2. Read Resource Set Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reads a previously registered resource set description 
using the GET method.  
If the request is successful, 
the authorization server MUST respond with a status message 
that includes an ETag header and _id and _rev properties 
for managing resource set description versioning.

Form of a "read resource set description" HTTP request:

::

   GET /resource_set/{rsid} HTTP/1.1
   ...


Form of a successful HTTP response:

::

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/intro-resource-set+json
   ...

   (body contains JSON resource set description, including _id and _rev)

If the referenced resource does not exist, 
the authorization server MUST produce an error response 
with an error property value of "not_found", as defined in Section 2.3.

On successful read, 
the authorization server MAY return a redirect
policy URI to the resource server in a property with the name
"policy_uri".  This URI allows the resource server to redirect the
user to a specific user interface within the authorization server
where the user can immediately set or modify access policies for the
resource set that was read.
