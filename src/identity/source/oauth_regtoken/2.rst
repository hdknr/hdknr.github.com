2.  Registered JWT
================================

The Registered JWT is a JWT that is registered to an entity. 
To achieve it, 
this document defines the two new claims for JWT.

.. glossary::

   rto
      String. 

      Required if rcu is not available. 

      The identifier of the :term:`entity` that this JWT is registered to. 
      This is primarily used in the case that the registered owner of the JWT will not change.

   rcu
      String. 

      Required if rto is not available. 

      A URL to which the jwi claim is sent 
      to obtain the identifier of the registered owner of the JWT. 

      This is used in the case 
      where the registered owner of the JWT will change over time.

In addition, the Registered JWT MUST have the following claims.

.. glossary::

   typ
      The value of the typ standard JWT claim MUST be "rjwt".

Following is a non‚Äênormative example of the JWT payload with the
above claims.

.. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "typ":"rjwt",
        "rto":"https://example.com/",
      }
