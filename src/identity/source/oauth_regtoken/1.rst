:doc:`OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage <oauth_bearer>` follows 
the "Bearer Instrument" pattern that 
the token is not registered to any party, 
thus the token can be used by **any party** that act as a bearer. 

The flexibility provided by this pattern is very flexible. 
However, 
when it has its weakness in the cases of **token loss**. 

This draft addresses the issue with another very popular pattern 
in the area of financial instruments called "registered instruments". 
In this case, 
the token is registered to a user, 
thus it will not be usable by any other party than the registered user 
whose identity can be verified through evidence of identity.

.. note::
    - Proofed Token ?
    - :ref:`oauth_threat.3.1` では Bearer Token とProof Token の２つに分類されていますよ

To achieve the same effect as the "registered instruments", 
this draft uses JWT as the token type 
and defines two additional claims to make it possible 
to obtain the identifier of the rightful registered owner of the token.

In addition, 
this draft defines a method to verify that the exerciser
of the token is the registered owner of the token.
