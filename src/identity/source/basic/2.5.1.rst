2.5.1.  UserInfo Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clients MAY send requests with the following parameters to the UserInfo Endpoint to obtain further information about the End-User. The UserInfo Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0] Protected Resource that complies with the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens [OAuth.Bearer] specification. As such, the Access Token SHOULD be specified via the HTTP Authorization header.

    access_token
        REQUIRED. 
        The Access Token obtained from an OpenID Connect Authorization Request. 
        This parameter MUST only be sent using one method 
       through either the HTTP Authorization header or a form-encoded HTTP POST body parameter. 

    schema
        REQUIRED. The schema in which the data is to be returned. The only defined value is openid. 
    id
        This identifier is reserved. It MUST be ignored by the endpoint when the openid schema is used. 

The following is a non-normative example:

    GET /userinfo?schema=openid HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Authorization: Bearer SlAV32hkKG
