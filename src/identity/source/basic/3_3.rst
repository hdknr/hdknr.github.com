3.3.  Check ID Endpoint
---------------------------------

The :term:`Check ID Endpoint` validates the id_token and 
returns a text JSON [:rfc:`4627`] object which contains information
about the End-User associated with the supplied :term:`id_token`.

Clients MUST verify the validity of the id_token using the Check ID Endpoint. 

The id_token is used to manage the **signon event** and **user identifier**. 
It differs from an :term:`Access Token` which provides access to the UserInfo Endpoint and 
other OAuth 2.0 protected resources that the End-User is granting access to. 

The id_token is restricted to a particular client via the :term:`aud` (audience) and :term:`nonce` claims.

A full explination of how to use the id_token to perform session management can be found
in the :doc:`OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 <session>` [openID.Session]
