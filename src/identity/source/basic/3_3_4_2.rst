3.3.4.2.  Response Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To verify the validity of the Response, the client MUST to the following:

    1.  If the authentication request contained a **nonce**, 
        check that the returned nonce is valid.

    2.  Verify that the response was intended for the recipient, 
        using the **aud** (audience) contained within the response.
    
    3.  If **issued_to** is present 
        then it MUST contain an identifier for a trusted intermediary. 
        If issued_to is unknown then the assertion MUST be rejected.

    4.  Check that the server that responded was really the intended server 
        through a TLS/SSL server **certificate check**.

    5.  The Check Session Endpoint has not returned an error for the **token**
        being expired or invalid.
