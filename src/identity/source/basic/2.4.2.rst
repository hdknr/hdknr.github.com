2.4.2.  UserInfo Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the requested schema is :term:`openid`, 
the response MUST return a JSON object 
that contains the full set or subset of Claims 
that are defined below. 
Additional Claims (not specified below) MAY also be returned.

If a Claim is not returned, 
that Claim Name SHOULD be omitted from the JSON object representing the Claims; 
it **SHOULD NOT** be present with a **null** or **empty string value**.

.. note::
    Drop claims if you don't want to return.

The members MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts. 
To specify the languages and scripts, 
BCP47 [:term:`RFC5646`] language tags MUST be added to each member names delimited by a #, e.g., familyName#ja-Kana-JP for expressing Family Name in Katakana in Japanese, which is commonly used to index and represent the phonetics of the Kanji representation of the same represented as familyName#ja-Hani-JP.

Following is a non-normative example of such response:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
     "user_id": "248289761001",
     "name": "Jane Doe",
     "given_name": "Jane",
     "family_name": "Doe",
     "email": "janedoe@example.com",
     "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
    }

The UserInfo Endpoint MUST return Claims in JSON format 
unless a different format was specified during OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration]. 
The UserInfo Endpoint MUST return a **content-type** header to indicate which format is being returned. 
The following are accepted content types:

.. list-table::

    *   - Content-Type    
        - Format Returned

    *   - application/json    
        - plain text JSON object

    *   - application/jwt 
        - A JWT
