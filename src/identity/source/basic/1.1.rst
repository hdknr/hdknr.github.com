1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions
----------------------------------------------------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are to be taken literally. When using these values in protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

All uses of JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] data structures in this specification utilize the JWS Compact Serialization; the JWS JSON Serialization is not used.

When the RFC 2119 language applies to the behavior of OpenID Providers, it is in this specification for explanatory value to help Client implementers understand the expected behavior of OpenID Providers.
