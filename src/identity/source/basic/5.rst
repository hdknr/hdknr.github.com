5.  Discovery and Registration
=================================

Some OpenID Connect installations can use a pre-configured set of OpenID Providers and/or Relying Parties. 
In those cases, it may not be necessary to support dynamic discovery of information about identities 
or services or dynamic registration of clients.

However, if installations choose to support unanticipated interactions between Relying Parties 
and OpenID Providers that do not have pre-configured relationships, 
they SHOULD accomplish this by implementing the facilities defined in the OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [:doc:`discovery`] 
and :doc:`OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration] <reg>` specifications.
