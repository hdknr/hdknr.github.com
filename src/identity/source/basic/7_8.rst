7.8.  Implicit Flow Threats
--------------------------------

In the implicit flow, the access token is returned in the fragment part of the client's redirect_uri through HTTPS. 
Thus it is protected between the Authorization Server and the User-Agent, 
and User-Agent and the Client. 
The only the place it can be captured is the User-Agent where the TLS session is terminated, 
and is possible if the User-Agent is infested by malware.
