2.2.4.  Authorization Server Obtains the End-User Consent/Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Authorization Server obtains an authorization decision, 
for the requested :term:`scopes <scope>`. 
This can done by presenting the End-User with a dialogue 
that allows the End-User to recognize 
what he is consenting to 
and obtain his consent 
or by establishing consent via other means 
(for example, via previous administrative consent).

The :term:`openid` scope grants the RP access to the user identifier 
of the authenticated End-User of the session.

All other scopes are optional. 

It is up to the OpenID Provider to determine if an error should be returned 
in the case of the End-User declining to authorize scopes other than openid.
