2.3.  ID Token
---------------------------------------------

The ID Token is a security token that contains Claims 
about the authentication event and other requested Claims. 
The ID Token is represented as a :doc:`JSON Web Token (JWT) <jwt>` :term:`[JWT]`.

The ID Token is used to manage the authentication event and user identifier and is scoped to a particular Client via the aud (audience) and nonce Claims.

The following Claims are REQUIRED within the ID Token:

.. glossary::

    iss
        REQUIRED. The Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response. 

    user_id
        REQUIRED. 

        A locally unique and never reassigned identifier 
        within the Issuer for the End-User, 
        which is intended to be consumed by the Client. 
        e.g. 24400320 or AItOawmwtWwcT0k51BayewNvutrJUqsvl6qs7A4. 

        It MUST NOT exceed 255 ASCII characters in length. 

    aud
        REQUIRED. 

        This member identifies the audience that this ID Token is intended for. 

        It MUST be the OAuth 2.0 client_id of the Client. 

    exp
        REQUIRED. 

        Type Integer. 

        Identifies the expiration time on or after 
        which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing. 
        The processing of this parameter requires 
        that the current date/time MUST be 
        before the expiration date/time listed in the value. 

        Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, 
        usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. 

        The value is number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC 
        until the desired date/time. See RFC 3339 :term:`[RFC3339]` 
        for details regarding date/times in general and UTC in particular. 

    iat
        REQUIRED. 
    
        Type Integer. 

        The iat (issued at) Claim identifies the time at which the JWT was issued. 

        The value is number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC 
        until the desired date/time. 

        See RFC 3339 :term:`[RFC3339]` for details regarding date/times in general and UTC in particular. 

Additional optional claims may be present in the :term:`ID Token`.
