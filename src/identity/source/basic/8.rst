8.  Privacy Considerations
=================================

The UserInfo response typically contains Personally Identifiable Information. 
As such, user consent for the release of the information for the specified purpose SHOULD be obtained at or prior to the authorization time
in accordance with relevant regulations. 
The purpose of use is typically registered in association with the redirect_uri.

Only necessary UserInfo data should be stored at the client 
and the client SHOULD associate the received data with the purpose of use statement.

The server SHOULD make the UserInfo access log available to the user
so that the user can monitor who accessed his data.

To protect the user from a possible correlation among clients,  
the use of a Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (:term:`PPID`) as the user_id SHOULD be considered.
