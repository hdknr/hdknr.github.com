2.2.  Code Flow
------------------------

The Code Flow consists of the following steps:

    1.    Client prepares an Authorization Request containing the desired request parameters.
    2.    Client sends a request to the Authorization Server.
    3.    Authorization Server authenticates the End-User.
    4.    Authorization Server obtains the End-User Consent/Authorization.
    5.    Authorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client with code.
    6.    Client sends the code to the Token Endpoint to receive an Access Token and ID Token in the response.
