2.2.  ID Token
---------------------------

The ID Token is a security token that contains Claims 
about the authentication event and other requested Claims. 

The ID Token is represented as a JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT].

The ID Token is used to manage the authentication event and user identifier and is scoped to a particular Client via the aud (audience) Claim.

The following Claims are used within the ID Token:

.. glossary::

    iss
        REQUIRED. Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response. The iss value is a case sensitive URL using the https scheme that contains scheme, host, and OPTIONALLY, port number and path components and no query or fragment components.
    
    sub
        REQUIRED. Subject identifier. A locally unique and never reassigned identifier within the Issuer for the End-User, which is intended to be consumed by the Client, e.g., 24400320 or AItOawmwtWwcT0k51BayewNvutrJUqsvl6qs7A4. It MUST NOT exceed 255 ASCII characters in length. The sub value is a case sensitive string.
    
    aud
        REQUIRED. Audience(s) that this ID Token is intended for. It MUST contain the OAuth 2.0 client_id of the Relying Party as an audience value. It MAY also contain identifiers for other audiences. In the general case, the aud value is an array of case sensitive strings. In the special case when there is one audience, the aud value MAY be a single case sensitive string.
    
    exp
        REQUIRED. Expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing. The processing of this parameter requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the value. Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. The time is represented as the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time. See RFC 3339 [RFC3339] for details regarding date/times in general and UTC in particular. The exp value is a number.
    
    iat
        REQUIRED. Time at which the JWT was issued. The time is represented as the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time. The iat value is a number.
    
    auth_time
        OPTIONAL or REQUIRED. Time when the End-User authentication occurred. The time is represented as the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time. When a max_age request is made then this Claim is REQUIRED. The auth_time value is a number.
    
    nonce
        OPTIONAL. String value used to associate a Client session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks. The value is passed through unmodified from the Authorization Request to the ID Token. The Client MUST verify that the nonce Claim Value is equal to the value of the nonce parameter sent in the Authorization Request. If present in the Authorization Request, Authorization Servers MUST include a nonce Claim in the ID Token with the Claim Value being the nonce value sent in the Authorization Request. Use of the nonce is OPTIONAL when using the code flow. The nonce value is a case sensitive string.
    
    at_hash
        OPTIONAL. Access Token hash value. This is OPTIONAL when the ID Token is issued from the Token Endpoint, which is the case for this profile; nonetheless, an at_hash Claim MAY be present. Its value is the base64url encoding of the left-most half of the hash of the octets of the ASCII representation of the access_token value, where the hash algorithm used is the hash algorithm used in the alg parameter of the ID Token's JWS [JWS] header. For instance, if the alg is RS256, hash the access_token value with SHA-256, then take the left-most 128 bits and base64url encode them. The at_hash value is a case sensitive string.
    
    acr
        OPTIONAL. Authentication Context Class Reference. String specifying an Authentication Context Class Reference value that identifies the Authentication Context Class that the authentication performed satisfied. The value "0" indicates the End-User authentication did not meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 29115 [ISO29115] level 1. Authentication using a long-lived browser cookie, for instance, is one example where the use of "level 0" is appropriate. Authentications with level 0 SHOULD never be used to authorize access to any resource of any monetary value. An absolute URI or a registered name [RFC6711] SHOULD be used as the acr value; registered names MUST NOT be used with a different meaning than that which is registered. Parties using this claim will need to agree upon the meanings of the values used, which may be context-specific. The acr value is a case sensitive string.
    
    amr
        OPTIONAL. Authentication Methods References. JSON array of strings that are identifiers for authentication methods used in the authentication. For instance, values might indicate that both password and OTP authentication methods were used. The definition of particular values to be used in the amr Claim is beyond the scope of this specification. Parties using this claim will need to agree upon the meanings of the values used, which may be context-specific. The amr value is an array of case sensitive strings.
    
    azp
        OPTIONAL or REQUIRED. Authorized Party - the party to which the ID Token was issued. If present, it MUST contain the OAuth 2.0 client_id of the party that will be using it. This Claim is only REQUIRED when the party requesting the ID Token is not the same as the sole audience of the ID Token. It MAY be included even when the Authorized Party is the same as the sole audience. The azp value is a case sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value.


ID Tokens MAY contain other Claims. Any Claims used that are not understood MUST be ignored.

ID Tokens SHOULD NOT use the JWS or JWE x5u, x5c, jku, or jwk header parameter fields. Instead, key values and key references used for ID Tokens are communicated in advance using Discovery and Registration parameters.

The following is a non-normative example of a base64url decoded ID Token:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
   "iss": "https://server.example.com",
   "sub": "24400320",
   "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
   "exp": 1311281970,
   "iat": 1311280970
  }
