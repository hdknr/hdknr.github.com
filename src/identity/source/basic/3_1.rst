3.1.  OpenID Connect Scopes
------------------------------------

OpenID Connect clients use scopes as defined in :ref:`3.3 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth.2.0]  <oauth_3_3>`
to specify what access privileges are requested for :term:`Access Tokens`. 
The scopes associated with Access Tokens determine **what resources will be available**
when they are used to access OAuth 2.0 protected endpoints. 
For OpenID Connect, scopes request what **information is to be made available from the UserInfo Endpoint, and to request an ID Token**. 
OAuth 2.0 allows additional scopes to be specified, as extensions. 
This specification only describes scopes that are part of OpenID Connect.

.. note::

    - OAuth :  type of resource
    - OpenID:  type of information at :term:`UserInfo Endpoint` 


OpenID Connect defines the following scopes:

    openid
        REQUIRED. 
        Informs the :term:`Authorization Server` that the client is making an OpenID request. 
        If the openid scope is not specified, the server SHOULD treat the request as a generic OAuth 2.0 request, 
        and perform no OpenID Connect processing. 

    profile
        OPTIONAL. 
        Requests default profile information. 

    email
        OPTIONAL. 
        Requests an email address. 

    address
        OPTIONAL. 
        Requests an address. 


Multiple scopes MAY be requested by creating a **space delimited**, **case sensitive** list of scope values.

The User **may decline a scope request** by the client.

To increase conversion, a site may elect to only request a subset of the information from the UserInfo Endpoint.

.. note::

    "Convertion" is unclear. `Issue 133 <https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issue/133>`_.

The following is a non-normative example of a Scope Request.
