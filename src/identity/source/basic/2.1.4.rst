2.1.4.  Authorization Server Obtains End-User Consent/Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Authorization Server obtains an authorization decision for the requested Claims. This can done by presenting the End-User with a dialogue that allows the End-User to recognize what he is consenting to and obtain his consent or by establishing consent via other means (for example, via previous administrative consent).

The openid scope value declares that this OAuth 2.0 request is an OpenID Connect request. Use of all other scope values is OPTIONAL.
