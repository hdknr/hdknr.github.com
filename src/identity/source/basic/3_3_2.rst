3.3.2.  Check ID Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: 

    This section is almost a copy of " :ref:`messages_3_1_1` ".

The response is a text JSON [:rfc:`4627`] object using the application/json media type with the following parameters.

.. glossary::

    iss
        REQUIRED. 
        The unique identifier of the issuer of the response.

    user_id
        REQUIRED. 
        A locally unique and never reassigned identifier for the user, 
        which is intended to be consumed by the Client. e.g. 24400320 or AItOawmwtWwcT0k51BayewNvutrJUqsvl6qs7A4. 
        It MUST NOT exceed **255 ASCII characters in length**.
    
    aud
        REQUIRED. 
        This member identifies the :term:`audience` that this :term:`ID Token` is intended for. 
        It is RECOMENDED that **aud** be client_id of the RP.
    
    exp
        REQUIRED. 
        Type Integer. 
        Identifies the expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing. 
        The processing of this parameter requires that the current date/time MUST be 
        before the expiration date/time listed in the value. 
        Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway [#]_ , usually no more than a few minutes, to account for `clock skew <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_skew>`_ . 
        The value is number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the desired date/time. 
        See RFC 3339 [:rfc:`3339`] for details regarding date/times in general and UTC in particular.

    iso29115
        OPTIONAL. (entity authentication assurance): 
        Specifies the X.eaa / ISO/IEC29115 [ISO29115] entity authentication assurance level of the authentication performed.

    nonce
        REQUIRED. 
        Clients MUST verify that the nonce value is equal to the exact value of nonce parameter in the Authorization Request. 

The following is a non-normative example of a request to the Introspection endpoint:
