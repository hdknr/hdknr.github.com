2.5.2.  UserInfo Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the requested schema is openid, the response MUST return a JSON object that contains the full set or subset of Claims that are defined below. Additional Claims (not specified below) MAY also be returned.

If a Claim is not returned, that Claim Name SHOULD be omitted from the JSON object representing the Claims; it SHOULD NOT be present with a null or empty string value.

The members MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts. To specify the languages and scripts, BCP47 [RFC5646] language tags MUST be added to each member names delimited by a #, e.g., family_name#ja-Kana-JP for expressing Family Name in Katakana in Japanese, which is commonly used to index and represent the phonetics of the Kanji representation of the same represented as family_name#ja-Hani-JP.

Following is a non-normative example of such a response:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
     "user_id": "248289761001",
     "name": "Jane Doe",
     "given_name": "Jane",
     "family_name": "Doe",
     "preferred_username": "j.doe",
     "email": "janedoe@example.com",
     "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
    }

The UserInfo Endpoint MUST return Claims in JSON format unless a different format was specified during OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration]. The UserInfo Endpoint MUST return a content-type header to indicate which format is being returned. The following are accepted content types:

    ------------------  --------------------------------- 
    Content-Type        Format Returned
    ------------------  --------------------------------- 
    application/json    plain text JSON object
    application/jwt     JSON Web Token (JWT)
    ------------------  ---------------------------------
