3.3.2.1.  Response Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To verify the validity of the Response, the client MUST do the following:

    1.  The :term:`Check ID Endpoint` has not returned an error for the :term:`ID Token` being expired or invalid.
    2.  Check that the :term:`iss` is equal to that of the pre-configured or discovered :term:`Issuer Identifier` for the user session.
    3.  Check that the returned :term:`nonce` is equal to the :term:`nonce` in the :term:`Authorization Request`.
    4.  Verify that the :term:`aud` (audience) contained within the response is the client's :term:`client_id`.
