7.1.  Assertion Manufacture/Modification
--------------------------------------------

An :term:`assertion` is **the result of the authentication** performed by the :term:`Authorization Server` that was provided to the client. 
The assertion is used to pass information about the user or the authentication process from the Authorization Server to the client.

To mitigate this attack, the assertion may be sent over a protected channel such as TLS/SSL. 
In order to protect the integrity of assertions from malicious attack, the server MUST be authenticated [#]_ . 
In this specification, the assertion is always sent over TLS/SSL protected channel.

For details of the threat, see [:term:`SP800â€‘63`].

.. [#] By checking the X.509 certificate used for TLS/SSL. (?)
