2.2.2.  Client sends a request to the Authorization Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Having constructed the Authorization Request, 
the Client sends it to the Authorization Endpoint. 

This MAY happen via HTTPS redirect, 
hyperlinking, 
or any other secure means of directing the User-Agent to the URL.

Following is a non-normative example using HTTP redirect 
(with line wraps for display purposes only):

::

    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: https://server.example.com/authorize?
    response_type=code
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &scope=openid%20profile
    &state=af0ifjsldkj

(draft 20)
