2.1.6.1.  Client Sends Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Client makes a request to the :term:`Token Endpoint` 
using the :term:`Form Serialization`, per :term:`Section 3.2 <basic.3.2>`, 
as described in :ref:`Section 4.1.3 of OAuth 2.0 <oauth.4.1.3>` [RFC6749]. 

The Client authenticates itself by communicating its form-urlencoded :term:`Client Credentials` 
in an :term:`Authorization header` using the HTTP Basic method, 
as described in :ref:`2.3.1 of OAuth 2.0 <oauth.2.3.1>`. 
(This method is the one identified by using the **client_secret_basic** authentication method value 
in :doc:`OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 <discovery>` [OpenID.Discovery]).

Communication with the Token Endpoint MUST utilize TLS. See :ref:`Section 7.1 <basic.7.1>` for more information on using TLS.

The following is a non-normative example of such a Token Request (with line wraps for the display purposes only):

::

  POST /token HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
  Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  grant_type=authorization_code&code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb
