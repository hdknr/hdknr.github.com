7.4.  Assertion Reuse
---------------------------

The assertion includes a timestamp and a short lifetime of validity. 
The client checks the **timestamp** and **lifetime values** to ensure that the assertion is currently valid.

The use of a **nonce** in the request is RECOMMENDED. 
The response from the Check ID Endpoint contains the nonce sent in the authorization request. 
This SHOULD be checked against a list of already received ID assertions to check for replays.

For details of the threat, see [SP800â€‘63].
