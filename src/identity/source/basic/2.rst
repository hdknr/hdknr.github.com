2.  Protocol Flows
=========================

Authorization Requests can follow one of two paths; 
the Implicit Flow or the Authorization Code Flow. 

The Authorization Code Flow is suitable for Clients 
that can securely maintain a Client Secret 
between themselves and the Authorization Server whereas, 
the Implicit Flow is suitable for Clients that cannot. 
Clients that do not support TLS MUST use the Authorization Code Flow 
to prevent the interception of Access Tokens.

The OpenID Connect Basic Client profile only documents Clients 
using the Code Flow. 
OpenID Providers MUST support both flows. 
OpenID Providers should consult 
the :doc:`OpenID Connect Standard 1.0 Specification <standard>` :term:`[OpenID.Standard]`.
