2.  Protocol Elements
================================

:term:`Authorization Requests` can follow one of two paths; 
the :term:`Implicit Flow` or the :term:`Authorization Code Flow`. 

The :term:`Authorization Code Flow` is suitable for Clients 
that can securely maintain a :term:`Client Secret` between themselves and the Authorization Server whereas, 
the :term:`Implicit Flow` is suitable for Clients that cannot.

This specification only provides information that is sufficient for basic Clients using the Code Flow.
