3.  Protocol Flows
=========================

Authorization Requests can follow one of two paths; the :term:`Implicit Flow` or the :term:`Authorization Code Flow`. 
The Authorization Code Flow is suitable for clients that can securely maintain a client secret 
between themselves and the :term:`Authorization Server` whereas, 
the Implicit Flow is suitable for clients that cannot. 
Clients that do not support TLS MUST use the Authorization Code Flow to prevent the interception of :term:`Access Tokens`.

The OpenID Connect Basic Client profile only documents clients using the :term:`Implicit Flow`. 
OpenID Providers MUST support both flows. 
Clients wanting to use the Authorization Code Flow and OpenID Providers should consult the :doc:`OpenID Connect Standard 1.0 specification <standard>`.


.. note::
    Basic = Implicit Flow
