1.  Introduction
====================================

OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile is 
a profile of the OpenID Connect Standard 1.0 Specification :term:`[OpenID.Standard]` 
that is designed to be **easy** to read and implement 
for basic web-based Relying Parties 
using the :ref:`OAuth code grant type. <oauth.code>` 

See the :doc:`OpenID Connect Implicit Client Profile <implicit>` 
:term:`[OpenID.Implicit]` specification for a related profile 
for basic web-based Relying Parties 
using the :ref:`OAuth implicit grant type <oauth.implicit>`. 

OpenID Providers and non web-based applications 
should consult the :doc:`Standard specification <standard>`. 

This profile omits implementation and security considerations for OpenID Providers.
