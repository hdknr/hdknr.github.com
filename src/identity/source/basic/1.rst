1.  Introduction
====================================

OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile 1.0 is a profile of the OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 [OpenID.Messages] 
and OpenID Connect Standard 1.0 [OpenID.Standard] specifications 
that is designed to be easy to read and implement for basic Web-based Relying Parties 
using the OAuth authorization_code grant type. 

This specification intentionally duplicates content from the Messages and Standard specifications 
to provide a self-contained implementation profile 
for basic Web-based Relying Parties 
using the OAuth :term:`authorization_code` grant type.

See the :doc:`OpenID Connect Implicit Client Profile 1.0 <implicit>` [OpenID.Implicit] specification 
for a related profile for basic Web-based Relying Parties 
using the OAuth implicit grant type. 

OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications should instead consult the Messages and Standard specifications. 

This profile omits implementation and security considerations for OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications.
