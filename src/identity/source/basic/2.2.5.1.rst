2.2.5.1.  End-User Grants Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the Resource Owner grants the access request, 
the Authorization Server issues a :term:`code` and delivers it to the Client 
by adding the following query parameters 
to the query component of the redirection URI 
using the **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** format 
as defined in :ref:`Section 4.1.2 of OAuth 2.0 <oauth.4.1.2>` :term:`[OAuth2.0]`.

.. glossary::

    code
        REQUIRED. The OAuth 2.0 authorization code. 

    state
        REQUIRED if the state parameter is present in the client Authorization Request. Clients MUST verify that the state value is equal to the exact value of state parameter in the Authorization Request. 


The following is a non-normative example (with line wraps after the second line for the display purposes only):

::

    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: https://client.example.org/cb?
