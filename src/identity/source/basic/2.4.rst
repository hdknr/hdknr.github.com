2.4.  ID Token Verification
--------------------------------------------------------

The client MUST verify the validity of ID Token in the Token Endpoint Response, the Client MUST first split the id_token at the period (".") characters, take the second segment, and base64url decode it to obtain a JSON object that includes the ID Token claims, which MUST be verified as follows:

1.    The Client MUST validate that 
      the :term:`iss` (issuer) Claim is valid 
      for the :term:`Token Endpoint` that the :term:`id_token` was received from.

2.    The Client MUST validate that 
      the client_id in the :term:`aud` (audience) Claim is one it has registered 
      for the Issuer identified by the value in the :term:`iss` (issuer) Claim. 

      The ID Token MUST be rejected if the value of :term:`aud` (audience) is not valid for the Issuer.

3.    The current time MUST be less than the value of the :term:`exp` Claim.

4.    The :term:`iat` Claim may be used to reject tokens 
      that were issued too far away from the current time, 
      limiting the amount of time that nonces must be stored to prevent attacks. 

      The acceptable range is Client specific.

5.    If the :term:`acr` Claim was requested, 
      the Client SHOULD check that the asserted Claim Value is appropriate. 
      The meaning and processing of :term:`acr` Claim Values is out of scope for this specification.

6.    If the :term:`auth_time` Claim was requested, 
      the Client SHOULD check the value and request re-authentication 
      if it determines too much time has elapsed since the last user authentication.
