4.  UserInfo Endpoint
=========================

To obtain the additional **attributes** and **tokens**, 
the client makes a GET or POST request to the UserInfo Endpoint.

User Info Endpoint Servers MUST require the use of a transport-layer security mechanism. 
The authorization server MUST support TLS 1.2 as described in RFC 5246 [:rfc:5246] 
and MAY support other transport-layer mechanisms with equivalent security.

NOTE: The :term:`UserInfo Endpoint` response is not guaranteed to be about the Subject in the session. 
Therefore, it MUST NOT be used as an assertion about the End-User 
in the session unless the :term:`user_id` matches the :term:`user_id` in the :term:`ID Token`. 

.. note::

    ID Token is the assertion in Connect.
    What is "User Info Endpoint Server" ?
