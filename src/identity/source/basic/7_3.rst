7.3.  Assertion Redirect
---------------------------------

To mitigate this threat, the assertion includes the identity of the client for whom it was generated as :term:`client_id`. 
The client verifies that incoming assertions include its identity as the recipient of the assertion.

For details of the threat, see :doc:`[SP800â€‘63] <nist-sp-800-63>`.
