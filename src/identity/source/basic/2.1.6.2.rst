2.1.6.2.  Client Receives Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Client receives a response with the following parameters as described in :ref:`Section 4.1.4 of OAuth 2.0 <oauth.4.1.4>` [RFC6749]. 

The response SHOULD be encoded using UTF-8.

.. glossary::

    access_token
        REQUIRED. Access Token for the UserInfo Endpoint.
    
    token_type
        REQUIRED. OAuth 2.0 Token Type value. The value MUST be Bearer or another token_type value that the Client has negotiated with the Authorization Server. Clients implementing this profile MUST support the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750] specification. This profile only describes the use of bearer tokens.

    id_token
        REQUIRED. ID Token.

    expires_in
        OPTIONAL. Expiration time of the Access Token in seconds since the response was generated.

    refresh_token
        OPTIONAL. Refresh Token.

The Client can then use the Access Token to access protected resources at Resource Servers.

The following is a non-normative example (with line wraps for the display purposes only):

::

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json
  Cache-Control: no-store
  Pragma: no-cache
  {
   "access_token":"SlAV32hkKG",
   "token_type":"Bearer",
   "expires_in":3600,
   "refresh_token":"tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA",
   "id_token":"eyJ0 ... NiJ9.eyJ1c ... I6IjIifX0.DeWt4Qu ... ZXso"
  }
