2.1.1.  Client Prepares Authorization Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the Client wishes to access a :term:`Protected Resource` 
and the End-User Authorization has not yet been obtained, 
the Client prepares an :term:`Authorization Request` to the :term:`Authorization Endpoint`.

Communication with the Authorization Endpoint MUST utilize TLS. See :ref:`Section 7.1 <basic.7.1>` for more information on using TLS.

Clients MAY construct the request using the HTTP GET or the HTTP POST method as defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616].

If using the HTTP GET method, the parameters are serialized using the Query String Serialization, per Section 3.1. If using the HTTP POST method, the request parameters are added to the HTTP request entity-body using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format as defined by [W3C.REC‑html401‑19991224].

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Request URL (with line wraps within values for display purposes only):

:: 

  https://server.example.com/authorize?
    response_type=code
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &scope=openid%20profile
    &state=af0ifjsldkj
