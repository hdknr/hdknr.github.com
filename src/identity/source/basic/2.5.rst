2.5.  UserInfo Endpoint
---------------------------

To obtain the additional attributes and tokens, the Client makes a GET or POST request to the UserInfo Endpoint.

UserInfo Endpoint Servers MUST require the use of a transport-layer security mechanism. The UserInfo Endpoint Server MUST support TLS 1.2 RFC 5246 [RFC5246] and/or TLS 1.0 [RFC2246] and MAY support other transport-layer mechanisms with equivalent security.

NOTE: The UserInfo Endpoint response is not guaranteed to be about the Interactive user identified by the user_id element of the ID Token. The user_id Claim in the UserInfo Endpoint response MUST exactly match the user_id Claim in the ID Token, before using additional UserInfo Endpoint Claims.
