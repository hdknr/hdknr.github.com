4.1.  Requesting UserInfo
-----------------------------

Clients MAY send requests with the following parameters to the UserInfo Endpoint 
to obtain further information about the End-User. 
The UserInfo Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 [OAuth.2.0] protected resource 
that complies with the :doc:`Bearer Token [OAuth.2.0.Bearer] specification <bearer>`. 
As such, the access token SHOULD be specified via the HTTP Authorization header. 


    access_token
        REQUIRED. The access_token obtained from an OpenID Connect :term:`Authorization Request`. 
        This parameter MUST only be sent using one method through either HTTP Authorization header or query string. 

    :term:`schema`
        REQUIRED. 
        The schema in which the data is to be returned. 
        The only defined value is **openid**. 
        If the value of this parameter is omitted, or not openid, 
        the response may be a proprietary schema to support backwards compatibility. 
        Custom schema names and responses are out of scope for this specification. 

    id
        This identifier is reserved for backwards compatibility. 
        It MUST be ignored by the endpoint if the openid schema is used.

.. todo::
    When is the **id**  used for backwards compatibility.

.. note::
    **access_token** MUST not delivered by a HTTP **POST** parameter.

The following is a non-normative example. Line wraps are for display purpose only::

    GET /userinfo HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Authorization: Bearer vF9dft4qmT
