3.2.3.  Authorization Server Obtains the End-User Consent/Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`Authorization Server` obtains an authorization decision, for the requested scopes. 
This can done by presenting the End-User with a dialogue 
that allows the End-User to recognize what he is consenting to 
and obtain his consent or by establishing approval via other means 
(for example, via previous administrative approval).

The **openid** scope grants the RP access to the user identifier of the authenticated End-User of the session.

All other scopes are optional. 
It is up to the OpenID Provider to determine if an error should be returned 
in the case of the End-User declining to authorize scopes other than openid.
