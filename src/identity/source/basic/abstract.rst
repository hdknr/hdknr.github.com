Abstract
==========

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer 
on top of the :doc:`OAuth 2.0 protocol <oauth>`. 
It allows :term:`Clients` to verify the :term:`identity` of the :term:`End-User` 
based on the authentication performed by an :term:`Authorization Server`, 
as well as to obtain :term:`basic profile information` about the :term:`End-User` 
in an interoperable and RESTful manner.

OpenID Connect Basic Client Profile is a profile 
of the OpenID Connect Standard 1.0 Specification 
that is designed to be easy to read and implement 
for basic web-based Relying Parties 
using the OAuth code grant type. 
OpenID Providers should consult the Standard specification. 
This profile omits implementation and security considerations for OpenID Providers.
