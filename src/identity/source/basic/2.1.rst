2.1.  Code Flow
---------------------------------------------

The Code Flow consists of the following steps:

    :ref:`1 <basic.2.1.1>`. Client prepares an Authorization Request containing the desired request parameters.
    :ref:`2 <basic.2.1.2>`. Client sends a request to the Authorization Server.
    :ref:`3 <basic.2.1.3>`. Authorization Server authenticates the End-User.
    :ref:`4 <basic.2.1.4>`. Authorization Server obtains the End-User Consent/Authorization.
    :ref:`5 <basic.2.1.5>`. Authorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client with code.
    :ref:`6 <basic.2.1.6>`. Client sends the code to the Token Endpoint to receive an Access Token and ID Token in the response.
