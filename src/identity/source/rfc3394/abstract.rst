Abstract
===============

The purpose of this document is to make 
the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Key Wrap algorithm 
conveniently available to the Internet community.  

The United States of America has adopted AES 
as the new encryption standard.  

The AES Key Wrap algorithm will probably 
be adopted by the USA for encryption of AES keys. 

The authors took most of the text 
in this document from the draft AES Key Wrap posted by NIST.
