2.2.3 Key Data Integrity -- the Initial Value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The initial value (IV) refers to 
the value assigned to **A[0]** 
in the first step of the wrapping process.  

This value is used to obtain 
an integrity check on the key data.  

In the final step of the unwrapping process, 
the recovered value of A[0] is compared 
to the expected value of A[0].  

If there is a match, 
the key is accepted as valid, 
and the unwrapping algorithm returns it.  

If there is not a match,
then the key is rejected, 
and the unwrapping algorithm returns an error.

The exact properties achieved 
by this integrity check depend 
on the definition of the initial value.  

Different applications may call for
somewhat different properties; 
for example, 
whether there is need to determine 
the integrity of key data 
throughout its lifecycle or just when it is unwrapped.  

This specification defines a default initial value 
that supports integrity of the key data 
during the period it is wrapped (:ref:`2.2.3.1 <rfc3394.2.2.3.1>`).  

Provision is also made to support 
alternative initial values (in :ref:`2.2.3.2 <rfc3394.2.2.3.1>`).
