2. Overview
==================

The AES key wrap algorithm is designed to wrap or encrypt key data.

The key wrap operates on blocks of 64 bits.  

Before being wrapped,
the key data is parsed into n blocks of 64 bits.


The only restriction the key wrap algorithm places 
on **n** is that **n** be at least two.  

(For key data with length less than or 
equal to 64 bits, 
the constant field used in this specification and 
the key data form a single 128-bit codebook input 
making this key wrap unnecessary.)  


The key wrap algorithm accommodates all supported AES key sizes.  

However, 
other cryptographic values often need to be wrapped.  

One such value is the seed of the random number generator for DSS.  

This seed value requires **n** to be greater than four.

Undoubtedly other values require this type of protection. 
Therefore,
no upper bound is imposed on **n**.


The AES key wrap can be configured 
to use any of the three key sizes supported by the AES codebook.  

The choice of a key size affects the overall security 
provided by the key wrap, 
but it does not alter the description of the key wrap algorithm.  

Therefore, 
in the description that follows, 
the key wrap is described generically; 
no key size is specified for the KEK.
