2.1 Notation and Definitions
------------------------------------------

The following notation is used in the description of 
the key wrapping algorithms:

::

      AES(K, W)     Encrypt W using the AES codebook with key K
      AES-1(K, W)   Decrypt W using the AES codebook with key K
      MSB(j, W)     Return the most significant j bits of W
      LSB(j, W)     Return the least significant j bits of W
      B1 ^ B2       The bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of B1 and B2
      B1 | B2       Concatenate B1 and B2
      K             The key-encryption key K
      n             The number of 64-bit key data blocks
      s             The number of steps in the wrapping process, s = 6n
      P[i]          The ith plaintext key data block
      C[i]          The ith ciphertext data block
      A             The 64-bit integrity check register
      R[i]          An array of 64-bit registers where i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n

      A[t], R[i][t] The contents of registers A and R[i] after encryption step t.

      IV            The 64-bit initial value used during the wrapping process.

In the key wrap algorithm, the concatenation function will be used to
concatenate 64-bit quantities to form the 128-bit input to the AES
codebook.  The extraction functions will be used to split the 128-bit
output from the AES codebook into two 64-bit quantities.
