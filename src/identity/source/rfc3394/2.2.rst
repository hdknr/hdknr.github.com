2.2 Algorithms
------------------------

The specification of the key wrap algorithm requires 
the use of the AES codebook [AES].  

The next three sections will describe 
the :ref:`key wrap algorithm <rfc3394.2.2.1>`, 
the :ref:`key unwrap algorithm <rfc3394.2.2.2>`, and 
the :ref:`inherent data integrity check <rfc3394.2.2.3>`.
