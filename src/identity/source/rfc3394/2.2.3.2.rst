2.2.3.2 Alternative Initial Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the key wrap is used 
as part of a larger key management protocol or system, 
the desired scope for data integrity 
may be more than just the key data 
or the desired duration for more than just the period
that it is wrapped.  

Also, 
if the key data is not just an AES key, 
it may not always be a multiple of 64 bits.  

Alternative definitions of the initial value 
can be used to address such problems.  

NIST will define alternative initial values 
in future key management publications as needed.  

In order to accommodate a set of alternatives 
that may evolve over time, 
key wrap implementations that are not application-specific 
will require some flexibility in the way 
that the initial value is set and tested.
