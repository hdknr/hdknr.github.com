10.7.  Resource Owner Password Credentials
------------------------------------------------------

   The resource owner password credentials grant type is often used for
   legacy or migration reasons.  It reduces the overall risk of storing
   usernames and passwords by the client but does not eliminate the need
   to expose highly privileged credentials to the client.

   This grant type carries a higher risk than other grant types because
   it maintains the password anti-pattern this protocol seeks to avoid.
   The client could abuse the password, or the password could
   unintentionally be disclosed to an attacker (e.g., via log files or
   other records kept by the client).

   Additionally, because the resource owner does not have control over
   the authorization process (the resource owner's involvement ends when
   it hands over its credentials to the client), the client can obtain
   access tokens with a broader scope than desired by the resource
   owner.  The authorization server should consider the scope and
   lifetime of access tokens issued via this grant type.

   The authorization server and client SHOULD minimize use of this grant
   type and utilize other grant types whenever possible.
