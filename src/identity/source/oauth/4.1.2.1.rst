4.1.2.1. Error Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the request fails due to a missing, invalid, or mismatching
redirection URI, or if the client identifier is missing or invalid,
the authorization server SHOULD inform the resource owner of the
error and MUST NOT automatically redirect the user-agent to the
invalid redirection URI.

If the resource owner denies the access request or if the request
fails for reasons other than a missing or invalid redirection URI,
the authorization server informs the client by adding the following
parameters to the query component of the redirection URI using the
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format, per Appendix B:


.. glossary::

   error
         REQUIRED.  A single ASCII [USASCII] error code from the
         following:

         .. glossary::   

             invalid_request
                   The request is missing a required parameter, includes an
                   invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than
                   once, or is otherwise malformed.
    
    
             unauthorized_client
                   The client is not authorized to request an authorization
                   code using this method.
    
             access_denied
                   The resource owner or authorization server denied the
                   request.
    
             unsupported_response_type
                   The authorization server does not support obtaining an
                   authorization code using this method.
    
             invalid_scope
                   The requested scope is 
                   **invalid**, **unknown**, or **malformed**.
    
             server_error
                   The authorization server encountered an unexpected
                   condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
                   (This error code is needed because a 500 Internal Server
                   Error HTTP status code cannot be returned to the client
                   via an HTTP redirect.)
    
             temporarily_unavailable
                   The authorization server is currently unable to handle
                   the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance
                   of the server.  (This error code is needed because a 503
                   Service Unavailable HTTP status code cannot be returned
                   to the client via an HTTP redirect.)

         Values for the "error" parameter MUST NOT include characters
         outside the set %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E.

   error_description
         OPTIONAL.  Human-readable ASCII [USASCII] text providing
         additional information, used to assist the client developer in
         understanding the error that occurred.
         Values for the "error_description" parameter MUST NOT include
         characters outside the set %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E.

   error_uri
         OPTIONAL.  A URI identifying a human-readable web page with
         information about the error, used to provide the client
         developer with additional information about the error.
         Values for the "error_uri" parameter MUST conform to the
         URI-reference syntax and thus MUST NOT include characters
         outside the set %x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E.

   state
         REQUIRED if a "state" parameter was present in the client
         authorization request.  The exact value received from the
         client.

For example, the authorization server redirects the user-agent by
sending the following HTTP response:

::

   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Location: https://client.example.com/cb?error=access_denied&state=xyz
