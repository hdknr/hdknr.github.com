    Authorization Grant
        An authorization grant is a **credential representing** 
        the :term:`resource owner`'s authorization 
        (to access its :term:`protected resources <protected resource>`) 
        used by the :term:`client` to obtain an :term:`access token`.  
        This specification defines **four grant types**: 
        :ref:`authorization code <oauth_1_3_1>`, 
        :ref:`implicit <oauth_1_3_2>`, 
        :ref:`resource owner password credentials <oauth_1_3_3>`, and 
        :ref:`client credentials <oauth_1_3_4>`, 
        as well as an :ref:`extensibility mechanism for defining additional types <oauth_4_5>`.
