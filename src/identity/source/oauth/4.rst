4. Obtaining Authorization
=======================================

To request an :term:`access token`, 
the client obtains authorization from the :term:`resource owner`.  

The authorization is expressed in the form of an :term:`authorization grant`, 
which the client uses to request the access token.  

OAuth defines four grant types: :term:`authorization code`, :term:`implicit`,
:term:`resource owner password credentials`, and :term:`client credentials`.  

.. note::
    - :ref:`oauth.4.1`
    - :ref:`oauth.4.2`
    - :ref:`oauth.4.3`
    - :ref:`oauth.4.4`

It also provides an extension mechanism for defining additional grant types.
