3.1.2.3.  Dynamic Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If multiple redirection URIs have been registered, if only part of
the redirection URI has been registered, or if no redirection URI has
been registered, the client MUST include a redirection URI with the
authorization request using the "redirect_uri" request parameter.

When a :term:`redirection URI` is included in an authorization request, 
the authorization server MUST compare and match the value received against 
at least one of the registered redirection URIs 
(or URI components) as defined in [:term:`RFC3986`] section 6, 
if any redirection URIs were registered.  
If the client registration included the full redirection URI, 
the authorization server MUST compare the two URIs
using simple string comparison as defined in [:term:`RFC3986`] section 6.2.1.
