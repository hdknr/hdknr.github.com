10.3. Access Tokens
------------------------------------

.. note::
    - アクセストークンはクレデンシャル

Access token credentials 
(as well as any confidential access token attributes) 
MUST be kept confidential in transit and storage, 
and only shared among the :term:`authorization server`, 
the :term:`resource servers` the access token is valid for, 
and the client to whom the access token is issued.  
Access token credentials MUST only be transmitted 
using TLS as described in Section 1.6 
with server authentication as defined by :term:`[RFC2818]`.

When using the :ref:`implicit grant type <oauth.implict>`, 
the access token is transmitted in the :term:`URI fragment`, 
which can expose it to unauthorized parties.

The :term:`authorization server` MUST ensure that 
access tokens cannot be generated, modified, 
or guessed to produce valid access tokens by unauthorized parties.

The client SHOULD request access tokens with the minimal scope necessary.  
The authorization server SHOULD take the client identity into account 
when choosing how to honor the requested scope 
and MAY issue an access token with less rights than requested.

This specification does not provide any methods 
for the resource server to ensure that an access token 
presented to it by a given client was issued to that client 
by the authorization server.
