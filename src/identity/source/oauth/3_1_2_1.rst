3.1.2.1.  Endpoint Request Confidentiality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The redirection endpoint SHOULD require 
the use of TLS as described in Section 1.6 
when the requested response type is ":term:`code`" or ":term:`token`",
or when the redirection request will result 
in the transmission of sensitive credentials over an open network.  
This specification does not mandate the use of TLS 
because at the time of this writing, 
requiring clients to deploy TLS is a significant 
hurdle for most client developers.

Lack of transport-layer security can have a severe impact 
on the security of the client 
and the protected resources it is authorized to access.  
The use of transport-layer security is particularly critical 
when the authorization process is used as a form of delegated end-user authentication 
by the client (e.g. third-party sign-in service).
