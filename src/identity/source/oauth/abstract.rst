Abstract
==========

The OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol enables a third-party application 
to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, 
either on behalf of a :term:`resource owner` by orchestrating an approval interaction
between the resource owner and the HTTP service, 
or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.  
This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described in RFC 5849.
