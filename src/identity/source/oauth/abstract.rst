Abstract
==========

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables 
a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, 
either on behalf of a :term:`resource owner` 
by orchestrating an approval interaction 
between the :term:`resource owner` and the HTTP service, 
or by allowing the third-party application 
to obtain access on its own behalf.  
This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described in :rfc:`5849` .
