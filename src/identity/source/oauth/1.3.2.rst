1.3.2.  Implicit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The implicit grant is a simplified authorization code flow optimized
for clients implemented in a browser using a scripting language such
as :term:`JavaScript`.  
In the implicit flow, 
instead of issuing the client an authorization code, 
the client is issued an :term:`access token` directly
(as the result of the resource owner authorization).  
The grant type is implicit, 
as no intermediate credentials (such as an authorization code) 
are issued (and later used to obtain an access token).

When issuing an access token during the implicit grant flow, 
the authorization server does not authenticate the client.  In some
cases, the client identity can be verified via the :term:`redirection URI`
used to deliver the access token to the client.  The access token may
be exposed to the resource owner or other applications with access to
the resource owner's user-agent.

.. note::

    - resource requester( client ) IS not authenticated. 
    - Access token holders is valid requesters.
    - redirection URL for tokens to be returned may be verified by tokens issuers. 
    - access tokes ARE EXPOSED to:

        - resource owner( end-user), because he operates his browser
        - other applications which running on the same user agent.

Implicit grants improve the responsiveness and efficiency of some
clients (such as a client implemented as an in-browser application),
since it reduces the number of round trips required to obtain an
access token.  
However, this convenience should be weighed against
the security implications of using implicit grants, such as those
described in Sections :ref:`10.3 <oauth.10.3>` and :ref:`10.16 <oauth.10.16>`, 
especially when the authorization code grant type is available.
