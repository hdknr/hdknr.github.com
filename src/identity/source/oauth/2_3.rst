2.3.  Client Authentication
---------------------------------------

If the :ref:`client type <oauth_2_1>` is :term:`confidential`, 
the :term:`client` and :term:`authorization server` establish a client authentication method 
suitable for the security requirements of the :term:`authorization server`.  
The :term:`authorization server` MAY accept any form of client authentication meeting its
security requirements.

:term:`Confidential clients` are typically issued (or establish) 
a set of :term:`client credentials` used for authenticating 
with the :term:`authorization server` 
(e.g. password, public/private key pair).

The :term:`authorization server` MAY establish a client authentication method
with :term:`public clients`.  
However, the :term:`authorization server` MUST NOT rely on public client authentication 
for the purpose of identifying the :term:`client`.

The :term:`client` MUST NOT use more than one authentication method 
in each request.
