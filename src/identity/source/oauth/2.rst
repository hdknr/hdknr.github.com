2. Client Registration
=======================================

Before initiating the protocol, 
the :term:`client` registers with the :term:`authorization server`.  
The means through which the client registers 
with the :term:`authorization server` are beyond the scope of this specification 
but typically involve end-user interaction with an HTML registration form.

Client registration does not require a direct interaction between the
client and the authorization server.  
When supported by the authorization server, 
registration can rely on other means for
establishing trust and obtaining the required client properties
(e.g., redirection URI, client type).  
For example, 
registration can be accomplished using a self-issued or third-party-issued assertion,
or by the authorization server performing client discovery using a
trusted channel.

When registering a client, the client developer SHALL:

-  specify the :term:`client type` as described in :ref:`Section 2.1 <oauth.2.1>`,

-  provide its :term:`client redirection URIs` as described in :ref:`Section 3.1.2 <oauth.3.1.2>`,
   and

-  include any other information required by the authorization server
   (e.g., :term:`application name`, website, description, logo image, the
   acceptance of legal terms).
