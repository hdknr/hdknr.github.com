2.  Client Registration
=======================================

Before initiating the protocol, 
the :term:`client` registers with the :term:`authorization server`.  
The means through 
which the :term:`client` registers with the :term:`authorization server` are beyond 
the scope of this specification, 
but typically involve end-user interaction with an HTML registration form.

:term:`Client registration` does not require a direct interaction 
between the :term:`client` and the :term:`authorization server`.  
When supported by the :term:`authorization server`, 
registration can rely on other means for establishing trust 
and obtaining the required client properties 
(e.g. :term:`redirection URI`, :term:`client type`).  
For example, 
registration can be accomplished using a self-issued 
or third-party-issued assertion, 
or by the :term:`authorization server` performing :term:`client discovery` 
using a trusted channel.

When registering a client, 
the client developer:

   o  specifies the :term:`client type` as described in :ref:`Section 2.1 <oauth_2_1>`,

   o  provides its :term:`client redirection URIs` as described in
      :ref:`Section 3.1.2 <oauth_3_1_2>`, and

   o  includes any other information required by the :term:`authorization server` 
      (e.g. application name, website, description, logo image, the acceptance of legal terms).
