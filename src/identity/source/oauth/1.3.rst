1.3.  Authorization Grant
------------------------------------------------

An :term:`authorization grant` is a :term:`credential` 
representing the :term:`resource owner`'s authorization 
(to access its protected resources) used by the client to obtain an :term:`access token`.  
This specification defines four :term:`grant types` -- 
authorization code, implicit, resource owner password
credentials, and client credentials -- 
as well as an extensibility mechanism for defining additional types.
