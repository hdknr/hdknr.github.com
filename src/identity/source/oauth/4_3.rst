4.3.  Resource Owner Password Credentials
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in cases 
where the :term:`resource owner` has a trust relationship with the :term:`client`, 
such as its device operating system or a highly privileged application.  

The :term:`authorization server` should take special care 
when enabling this grant type, and only allow it when other flows are not viable.

The :term:`grant type` is suitable for clients capable of 
obtaining the resource owner's credentials 
(username and password, typically using an interactive form).  
It is also used to migrate existing clients using direct authentication schemes 
such as HTTP Basic or Digest authentication 
to OAuth by converting the stored credentials to an access token.

     |         |         Password Credentials     | Authorization |
     | Client  |                                  |     Server    |
     |         |<--(C)---- Access Token ---------<|               |
     |         |    (w/ Optional Refresh Token)   |               |
     +---------+                                  +---------------+



The flow illustrated in Figure 5 includes the following steps:

    (A)     The resource owner provides the client with its username and password.

    (B)     The client requests an access token from the authorization server's token endpoint 
            by including the credentials received from the resource owner.  
            When making the request, the client authenticates with the authorization server.

    (C)     The authorization server authenticates the client 
            and validates the resource owner credentials, 
            and if valid issues an access token.
