10.5.  Authorization Codes
------------------------------------------

   The transmission of authorization codes SHOULD be made over a secure
   channel, and the client SHOULD require the use of TLS with its
   redirection URI if the URI identifies a network resource.  Since
   authorization codes are transmitted via user-agent redirections, they
   could potentially be disclosed through user-agent history and HTTP
   referrer headers.

   Authorization codes operate as plaintext bearer credentials, used to
   verify that the resource owner who granted authorization at the
   authorization server is the same resource owner returning to the
   client to complete the process.  Therefore, if the client relies on
   the authorization code for its own resource owner authentication, the
   client redirection endpoint MUST require the use of TLS.

   Authorization codes MUST be short lived and single-use.  If the
   authorization server observes multiple attempts to exchange an
   authorization code for an access token, the authorization server
   SHOULD attempt to revoke all access tokens already granted based on
   the compromised authorization code.

   If the client can be authenticated, the authorization servers MUST
   authenticate the client and ensure that the authorization code was
   issued to the same client.
