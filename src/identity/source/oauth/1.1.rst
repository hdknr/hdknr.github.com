1.1.  Roles
----------------------------

OAuth defines four roles:

.. glossary::

   resource owner
   resource owners
      An entity capable of granting access to a :term:`protected resource`.
      When the :term:`resource owner` is a person, it is referred to as an
      :term:`end-user`.

   resource server
   resource servers
      The server hosting the :term:`protected resources`, 
      capable of accepting and responding to :term:`protected resource` requests 
      using :term:`access tokens`.

   client
   clients
      An application making :term:`protected resource` requests on behalf of the
      :ref:`resource owner` and with its authorization.  The term "client" does
      not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g.,
      whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other
      devices).

   authorization server
   authorization servers
      The server issuing :term:`access tokens` to the :term:`client` after successfully
      authenticating the :term:`resource owner` and obtaining authorization.

The interaction between the :term:`authorization server` and :ref:`resource server`
is beyond the scope of this specification.  
The :term:`authorization server` may be the same server as the resource server 
or a separate entity.
A single authorization server may issue access tokens accepted by
multiple resource servers.
