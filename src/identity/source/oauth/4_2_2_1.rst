4.2.2.1. Error Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    Error responses for :ref:`Implicit Grant <oauth_4_2>`

If the request fails due to a missing, invalid, or mismatching redirection URI, 
or if the client identifier provided is invalid, 
the authorization server SHOULD inform the resource owner of the error,
and MUST NOT automatically redirect the user-agent to the invalid redirection URI.

If the resource owner denies the access request or if the request fails 
for reasons other than a missing or invalid redirection URI,
the authorization server informs the client by adding the following parameters 
to the **fragment component** of the redirection URI using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format:

   error
         REQUIRED.  
         A single error code from the following:

         invalid_request
               The request is missing a required parameter, 
               includes an unsupported parameter value, or is otherwise malformed.

         unauthorized_client
               The client is not authorized to request an access token
               using this method.

         access_denied
               The resource owner or authorization server denied the request.

         unsupported_response_type
               The authorization server does not support obtaining an access token using this method.

         invalid_scope
               The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed.

         server_error
               The authorization server encountered an unexpected condition 
               which prevented it from fulfilling the request.

         temporarily_unavailable
               The authorization server is currently unable to handle
               the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.

   error_description
         OPTIONAL.  
         A human-readable UTF-8 encoded text providing
         additional information, used to assist the client developer in
         understanding the error that occurred.

   error_uri
         OPTIONAL.  A URI identifying a human-readable web page with
         information about the error, used to provide the client
         developer with additional information about the error.

   state
         REQUIRED if a valid "state" parameter was present in the client
         authorization request.  The exact value received from the client.

For example, the authorization server redirects the user-agent by
sending the following HTTP response:


::

   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Location: https://client.example.com/cb#error=access_denied&state=xyz
