3.1.2.2. Registration Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
    - **IMPORTANT** : regisiter redirect URI, just in case.
   

The authorization server MUST require the following clients to
register their redirection endpoint:

   -  Public clients.
   -  Confidential clients utilizing the implicit grant type.

The authorization server SHOULD require all clients to register their
redirection endpoint prior to utilizing the authorization endpoint.

The authorization server SHOULD require the client 
to provide the complete redirection URI 
(the client MAY use the "state" request parameter to achieve per-request customization).  
If requiring the registration of the complete redirection URI is not possible, 
the authorization server SHOULD require the registration of the URI scheme, 
authority, and path (allowing the client to dynamically vary 
only the query component of the redirection URI when requesting
authorization).

The authorization server MAY allow the client to register multiple
redirection endpoints.

Lack of a redirection URI registration requirement can enable an
attacker to use the authorization endpoint as an open redirector as
described in Section 10.15.
