3.2.1. Client Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:term:`Confidential clients`, 
clients issued client credentials, 
or clients assigned other authentication requirements MUST 
authenticate with the :term:`authorization server` 
as described in :ref:`Section 2.3 <oauth_2_2>` 
when making requests to the :term:`token endpoint`.  
:term:`Client` authentication is used for:

   -  Enforcing the binding of :term:`refresh tokens` and :term:`authorization codes` to
      the :term:`client` they are issued.  Client authentication is critical
      when an :term:`authorization code` is transmitted to the redirection
      endpoint over an insecure channel, or when the redirection URI has
      not been registered in full.

   -  Recovering from a compromised client by disabling the client or
      changing its credentials, thus preventing an attacker from abusing
      stolen refresh tokens.  Changing a single set of client
      credentials is significantly faster than revoking an entire set of :term:`refresh tokens`.

   -  Implementing :term:`authentication management best practices` which
      require :term:`periodic credential rotation`.  Rotation of an entire set
      of :term:`refresh tokens` can be challenging, while rotation of a single
      set of client credentials is significantly easier.

A :term:`public client` that was not issued a client password 
MAY use the ":term:`client_id`" request parameter to identify itself 
when sending requests to the :term:`token endpoint`.
