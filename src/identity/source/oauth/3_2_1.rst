3.2.1. Client Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:term:`Confidential clients`, 
or other clients issued client credentials MUST 
authenticate with the :term:`authorization server` 
as described in :ref:`Section 2.3 <oauth_2_2>` 
when making requests to the :term:`token endpoint`.
:term:`Client` authentication is used for:

   -  Enforcing the binding of :term:`refresh tokens` and :term:`authorization codes` to
      the :term:`client` they were issued to.  
      **Client authentication** is critical 
      when :term:`an authorization code` is transmitted to the :term:`redirection endpoint` 
      over an insecure channel, 
      or when the :term:`redirection URI` has not been registered in full.

   -  Recovering from a compromised client by disabling the client or
      changing its credentials, 
      thus preventing an attacker from abusing stolen :term:`refresh tokens`.  
      Changing a single set of client
      credentials is significantly faster than 
      revoking an entire set of :term:`refresh tokens`.

   -  Implementing :term:`authentication management best practices` which
      require :term:`periodic credential rotation`.  
      Rotation of an entire set of :term:`refresh tokens` can be challenging, 
      while rotation of a single set of client credentials is significantly easier.

A :term:`public client` that was not issued a client password 
MAY use the ":term:`client_id`" request parameter to identify itself 
when sending requests to the :term:`token endpoint`.
