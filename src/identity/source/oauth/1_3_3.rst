1.3.3. Resource Owner Password Credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The resource owner password credentials (i.e. username and password)
can be used directly as an authorization grant to obtain an access
token.  The credentials should only be used when there is a high
degree of trust between the resource owner and the client (e.g. its
device operating system or a highly privileged application), and when
other authorization grant types are not available (such as an
authorization code).

Even though this grant type requires direct client access to the
resource owner credentials, the resource owner credentials are used
for a single request and are exchanged for an access token.  This
grant type can eliminate the need for the client to store the
resource owner credentials for future use, by exchanging the
credentials with a long-lived access token or refresh token.
