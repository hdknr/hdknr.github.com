3.1.2.2.  Registration Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The authorization server MUST require the following clients to
register their redirection endpoint:

   -  :term:`Public clients`.
   -  :term:`Confidential clients` utilizing the :term:`implicit grant type`.

The authorization server SHOULD require all clients 
to register their redirection endpoint 
prior to utilizing the authorization endpoint

The authorization server SHOULD require the client 
to provide the complete redirection URI 
(the client MAY use the "state" request parameter to achieve per-request customization).  
If requiring the registration of the complete redirection URI is not possible, 
the authorization server SHOULD require the registration of the URI scheme, 
authority, and path 
(allowing the client to dynamically vary only the :term:`query component` 
of the redirection URI when requesting authorization).

The authorization server MAY allow the client 
to register **multiple** :term:`redirection endpoints`.

Lack of a redirection URI registration requirement 
can enable an attacker to use the authorization endpoint 
as :term:`open redirector` as described in :ref:`Section 10.15 <oauth_10_15>`.
