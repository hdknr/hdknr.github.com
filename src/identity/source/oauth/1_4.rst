1.4.  Access Token
--------------------

:term:`Access tokens` are credentials used to access :term:`protected resources`.  
An :term:`access token` is a string representing an authorization 
issued to the client.  
The string is usually opaque to the client.  
Tokens represent specific :term:`scopes` and :term:`durations of access`, 
granted by the :term:`resource owner`, 
and enforced by the :term:`resource server` and :term:`authorization server`.

The token may denote an identifier used to retrieve the authorization information, 
or self-contain the authorization information in a verifiable manner 
(i.e. a token string consisting of some data and a signature).  
Additional authentication credentials, 
which are beyond the scope of this specification, 
may be required in order for the :term:`client` to use a token.

The :term:`access token` provides an abstraction layer, 
replacing different authorization constructs 
(e.g. username and password) with a single token understood by the :term:`resource server`.  
This abstraction enables issuing :term:`access tokens` more restrictive 
than the :term:`authorization grant` used to obtain them, 
as well as removing the :term:`resource server`'s need to understand 
a wide range of authentication methods.

:term:`Access tokens` can have different formats, structures, and methods of utilization 
(e.g. cryptographic properties) based on the :term:`resource server` security requirements [#]_.  
:term:`Access token attributes` and the methods used to access :term:`protected resources` are 
beyond the scope of this specification and are defined by companion specifications.
