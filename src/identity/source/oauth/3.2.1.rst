3.2.1. Client Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Confidential clients or other clients issued client credentials MUST
authenticate with the authorization server as described in
:ref:`Section 2.3 <oauth.2.3>` when making requests to the token endpoint.  Client
authentication is used for:

   -  Enforcing the binding of refresh tokens and authorization codes to
      the client they were issued to.  Client authentication is critical
      when an authorization code is transmitted to the redirection
      endpoint over an insecure channel or when the redirection URI has
      not been registered in full.

   -  Recovering from a compromised client by disabling the client or
      changing its credentials, thus preventing an attacker from abusing
      stolen refresh tokens.  Changing a single set of client
      credentials is significantly faster than revoking an entire set of
      refresh tokens.

   -  Implementing authentication management best practices, which
      require periodic credential rotation.  Rotation of an entire set
      of refresh tokens can be challenging, while rotation of a single
      set of client credentials is significantly easier.


A client MAY use the ":term:`client_id"` request parameter 
to identify itself when sending requests to the :term:`token endpoint`.  

In the ":term:`authorization_code`" ":term:`grant_type`" request to the :term:`token endpoint`, 
an unauthenticated client MUST send its ":term:`client_id`" to prevent itself 
from inadvertently accepting a :term:`code` intended for a client with a different ":term:`client_id"`.  
This protects the client from substitution of the authentication code.  
(It provides no additional security for the protected resource.)
