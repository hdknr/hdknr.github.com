1.3.1.  Authorization Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`authorization code` is obtained by using an :term:`authorization server`
as an intermediary between the :term:`client` and :term:`resource owner`.  
Instead of requesting authorization directly from the :term:`resource owner`, 
the :term:`client` directs the :term:`resource owner` to an :term:`authorization server` 
(via its user-agent as defined in [:term:`RFC2616`]), 
which in turn directs the :term:`resource owner` back 
to the :term:`client` with the :term:`authorization code`.

Before directing the :term:`resource owner` back to the :term:`client` 
with the :term:`authorization code`, 
the :term:`authorization server` authenticates the :term:`resource owner` and obtains authorization.  
Because the :term:`resource owner` only authenticates with the :term:`authorization server`, 
the :term:`resource owner`'s credentials are never shared with the :term:`client`.

The :term:`authorization code` provides a few important security benefits
such as the ability to authenticate the :term:`client`, 
and the transmission of the :term:`access token` directly to the :term:`client` 
without passing it through the :term:`resource owner`'s user-agent, 
potentially exposing it to others, including the :term:`resource owner`.
