4.3.2. Access Token Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
format per Appendix B with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP request entity-body:

.. glossary::

   grant_type
         REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "password".

   username
         REQUIRED.  The resource owner username.

   password
         REQUIRED.  The resource owner password.

   scope
         OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request as described by
         Section 3.3.

If the client type is confidential 
or the client was issued client credentials 
(or assigned other authentication requirements), 
the client MUST authenticate with the authorization server as described
in :ref:`Section 3.2.1 <oauth.3.2.1>`.

For example, 
the client makes the following HTTP request using
transport-layer security (with extra line breaks for display purposes only):

::

     POST /token HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

     grant_type=password&username=johndoe&password=A3ddj3w



The authorization server MUST:

   -  require client authentication for confidential clients or for any
      client that was issued client credentials (or with other
      authentication requirements),

   -  authenticate the client if client authentication is included, and

   -  validate the resource owner password credentials using its
      existing password validation algorithm.

Since this access token request utilizes the resource owner's password, 
the authorization server MUST protect the endpoint against
brute force attacks (e.g., using rate-limitation or generating alerts).
