4.2.1. Authorization Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The client constructs the request URI by adding the following
parameters to the query component of the authorization endpoint URI
using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format, per Appendix B:

.. glossary::

    response_type
          REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "token".
    
    client_id
          REQUIRED.  The client identifier as described in Section 2.2.
    
    redirect_uri
          OPTIONAL.  As described in Section 3.1.2.
    
    scope
          **OPTIONAL**.  
    
          The scope of the access request as described by :ref:`Section 3.3 <oauth.3.3>`.
    
    state
          RECOMMENDED.  An opaque value used by the client to maintain
          state between the request and callback.  The authorization
          server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent back
          to the client.  The parameter SHOULD be used for preventing
          cross-site request forgery as described in Section 10.12.

The client directs the resource owner to the constructed URI using an
HTTP redirection response, or by other means available to it via the
user-agent.

For example, the client directs the user-agent to make the following
HTTP request using TLS (with extra line breaks for display purposes
only):

::

 GET /authorize?response_type=token&client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&state=xyz
     &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
 Host: server.example.com

The authorization server validates the request to ensure that all
required parameters are present and valid.  The authorization server
MUST verify that the redirection URI to which it will redirect the
access token matches a redirection URI registered by the client as
described in Section 3.1.2.

If the request is valid, the authorization server authenticates the
resource owner and obtains an authorization decision (by asking the
resource owner or by establishing approval via other means).

When a decision is established, the authorization server directs the
user-agent to the provided client redirection URI using an HTTP
redirection response, or by other means available to it via the
user-agent.
