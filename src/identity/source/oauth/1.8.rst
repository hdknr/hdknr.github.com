1.8. Interoperability
------------------------------------

OAuth 2.0 provides a rich authorization framework with well-defined
security properties.  However, as a rich and highly extensible
framework with many optional components, on its own, this
specification is likely to produce a wide range of non-interoperable
implementations.

In addition, this specification leaves a few required components
partially or fully undefined (e.g., client registration,
authorization server capabilities, endpoint discovery).  Without
these components, clients must be manually and specifically
configured against a specific authorization server and resource
server in order to interoperate.

.. note::

    Implements are required.

    - client registration
    - authorization server functions
    - discovery

This framework was designed with the clear expectation that future
work will define prescriptive profiles and extensions necessary to
achieve full web-scale interoperability.
