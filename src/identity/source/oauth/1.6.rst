1.6. TLS Version
--------------------

Whenever Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used by this
specification, the appropriate version (or versions) of TLS will vary
over time, based on the widespread deployment and known security
vulnerabilities.  At the time of this writing, TLS version 1.2
[RFC5246] is the most recent version, but has a very limited
deployment base and might not be readily available for
implementation.  TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246] is the most widely
deployed version and will provide the broadest interoperability.

Implementations MAY also support additional transport-layer security
mechanisms that meet their security requirements.
