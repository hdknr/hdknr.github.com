3.3. Access Token Scope
----------------------------

The authorization and token endpoints allow the client to specify the scope of the access request 
using the "**scope**" request parameter.  
In turn, the authorization server uses the "scope" response parameter 
to inform the client of the scope of the access token issued.

The value of the scope parameter is expressed as a list of space-delimited, case sensitive strings.  
The strings are defined by the authorization server.  
If the value contains multiple space-delimited strings, their order does not matter, 
and each string adds an additional access range to the requested scope.

The authorization server MAY fully or partially ignore the scope requested by the client 
based on the authorization server policy or the resource owner's instructions.  
If the issued access token scope is different from the one requested by the client, 
the authorization server SHOULD include the "scope" response parameter to inform the client of the actual scope granted.
