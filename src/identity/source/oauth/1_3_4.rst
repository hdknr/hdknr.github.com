1.3.4. Client Credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The client credentials (or other forms of client authentication) can
be used as an :term:`authorization grant` 
when the :term:`authorization scope` is limited to the :term:`protected resources` 
under the control of the client, 
or to :term:`protected resources` previously arranged with the :term:`authorization server`.  

Client credentials are used as an :term:`authorization grant`
typically 
when the client is acting on its own behalf (the client is also the :term:`resource owner`), 
or 
is requesting access to :term:`protected resources` based on an authorization 
previously arranged with the :term:`authorization server`.
