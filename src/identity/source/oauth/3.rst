3. Protocol Endpoints
=========================

The authorization process utilizes two endpoints (HTTP resources):

   o  :term:`Authorization endpoint` - used to obtain authorization from the
      resource owner via user-agent redirection.

   o  :term:`Token endpoint` - used to exchange an authorization grant for an
      access token, typically with client authentication.

Not every authorization grant type utilizes both endpoints.
Extension grant types MAY define additional endpoints as needed.
