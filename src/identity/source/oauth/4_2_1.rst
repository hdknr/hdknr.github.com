4.2.1. Authorization Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    - http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-22#section-4.2.1

The client constructs the :term:`request URI` by adding the following
parameters to the :term:`query component` of the :term:`authorization endpoint URI`
using the "**application/x-www-form-urlencoded**" format:

.. glossary::

   response_type
         REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "token".

   client_id
         REQUIRED.  The client identifier as described in :ref:`Section 2.2 <oauth_2_2>`.

   redirect_uri
         OPTIONAL, as described in :ref:`Section 3.1.2 <oauth_3_1_2>` .

   scope
         OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request as described by
         :ref:`Section 3.3 <oauth_3_3>`.

   state
         RECOMMENDED.  An opaque value used by the client to maintain
         state between the request and callback.  The authorization
         server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent back
         to the client.  The parameter SHOULD be used for preventing
         cross-site request forgery as described in :ref:`Section 10.12 <oauth_10_12>`.

The client directs the resource owner to the constructed URI using an
HTTP redirection response, or by other means available to it via the
user-agent.

For example, the client directs the user-agent to make the following
HTTP request using transport-layer security (extra line breaks are
for display purposes only):

::

    GET /authorize?response_type=token&client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&state=xyz
        &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com

The authorization server validates the request to ensure all required
parameters are present and valid.  The authorization server MUST
verify that the redirection URI to which it will redirect the access
token matches a redirection URI registered by the client as described
in :ref:`Section 3.1.2 <oauth_3_1_2>`.

If the request is valid, the authorization server authenticates the
resource owner and obtains an authorization decision (by asking the
resource owner or by establishing approval via other means).

When a decision is established, the authorization server directs the
user-agent to the provided client redirection URI using an HTTP
redirection response, or by other means available to it via the user-
agent.
