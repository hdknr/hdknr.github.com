1.1. Roles
------------------------

OAuth defines four roles:

.. glossary::

   resource owner
      An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource (e.g.
      end-user).

   resource server
      The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting
      and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

   client
      An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the
      resource owner and with its authorization.

   authorization server
      The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully
      authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.

The interaction between the :term:`authorization server` and term:`resource server`
is beyond the scope of this specification.  
The authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.
A single authorization server may issue :term:`access tokens` accepted by multiple resource servers.
