4.1.1. Authorization Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
     - http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-28#section-4.1.1


The client constructs the request URI by adding the following parameters 
to the query component of the authorization endpoint URI 
using the "**application/x-www-form-urlencoded**" format 
as defined by [W3C.REC-html401-19991224]:

.. glossary::

   response_type
         REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "code".

   client_id
         REQUIRED.  The client identifier as described in :ref:`Section 2.2 <oauth_2.2>`.

   redirect_uri
         OPTIONAL.  As described in :ref:`Section 3.1.2 <oauth_3_1_2>`.
   scope
         OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request as described by
         :ref:`Section 3.3 <oauth_3_3>`.

   state
         RECOMMENDED.  An opaque value used by the client to maintain
         state between the request and callback.  The authorization
         server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent back
         to the client.  The parameter SHOULD be used for preventing
         cross-site request forgery as described in Section 10.12.

The client directs the resource owner to the constructed URI 
using an HTTP redirection response, 
or by other means available to it via the user-agent.

For example, 
the client directs the user-agent to make the following HTTP request 
using TLS (extra line breaks are for display purposes only):

:: 

    GET /authorize?response_type=code&client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&state=xyz
        &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com


The authorization server validates the request to ensure all required
parameters are present and valid.  If the request is valid, the
authorization server authenticates the resource owner and obtains an
authorization decision (by asking the resource owner or by
establishing approval via other means).

When a decision is established, 
the authorization server directs the user-agent 
to the provided client redirection URI using an HTTP redirection response, 
or by other means available to it via the user- agent.
