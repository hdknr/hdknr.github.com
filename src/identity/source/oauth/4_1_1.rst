4.1.1. Authorization Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
     - http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-22#section-4.1.1

The client constructs the :term:`request URI` 
by adding the following parameters to the :term:`query component` 
of the :term:`authorization endpoint URI`
using the "**application/x-www-form-urlencoded**" format 
as defined by [:term:`W3C.REC-html401-19991224`]:

.. glossary::

   response_type
         REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to ":term:`code`".

   client_id
         REQUIRED.  
         The client identifier as described in :ref:`Section 2.2 <oauth_2_2>`.

   redirect_uri
         OPTIONAL, as described in :ref:`Section 3.1.2 <oauth_3_1_2>`.

   scope
         OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request as described by
         :ref:`Section 3.3 <oauth_3_3>`.

   state
         RECOMMENDED.  An opaque value used by the client to maintain
         state between the request and callback.  The authorization
         server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent back
         to the client.  The parameter SHOULD be used for preventing
         cross-site request forgery as described in :ref:`Section 10.12 <oauth_10_12>`.

The client directs the resource owner to the constructed URI using an
:term:`HTTP redirection response` or by other means [#]_ available to it via the user-agent.

.. [#] ummmm....

For example, 
the client directs the user-agent to make the following
HTTP request using transport-layer security (extra line breaks are
for display purposes only):

::

    GET /authorize?response_type=code&client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&state=xyz
        &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com

The :term:`authorization server` validates the request 
to ensure all required parameters are present and valid.  
If the request is valid, 
the :term:`authorization server` authenticates the :term:`resource owner` 
and obtains an authorization decision 
(by asking the :term:`resource owner` or by establishing approval via other means).

When a decision is established, 
the :term:`authorization server` directs the :term:`user-agent` 
to the provided client redirection URI using an HTTP redirection response, 
or by other means available to it via the user-agent.
