3.1.1. Response Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The authorization endpoint is used by the authorization code grant
type and implicit grant type flows.  The client informs the
authorization server of the desired grant type using the following
parameter:

.. glossary::

   response_type

         REQUIRED.  

         The value MUST be one of "**code**" for requesting 
         an :term:`authorization code` as described by :ref:`Section 4.1.1 <oauth.4.1.1>`, 
         "**token**" for requesting an :term:`access token` (:term:`implicit grant`) 
         as described by :ref:`Section 4.2.1 <oauth.4.2.1>`, 
         or a **registered extension value** as described by :ref:`Section 8.4 <oauth.8.4>`.

Extension response types MAY contain a space-delimited (%x20) list of values, 
where the order of values does not matter 
(e.g., response type "a b" is the same as "b a").  
The meaning of such **composite response types** is defined by their respective specifications.

If an authorization request is missing the ":term:`response_type`" parameter,
or if the response type is not understood, 
the authorization server MUST return an error response as described in :term:`Section 4.1.2.1 <oauth.4.1.2.1>`.
