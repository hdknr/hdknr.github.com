7.1. Access Token Types
---------------------------

.. note::

    "token_type" is one of  "bearer" or "mac" as of Draft 22 of OAuth2

The **access token type** provides the client 
with the information required to successfully utilize the access token to make a protected resource request 
(along with type-specific attributes).  
The client MUST NOT use an access token if it does not understand or does not trust the token type.

For example, the **"bearer"** token type defined in
[:doc:`I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-bearer <bearer>`] is utilized by simply including the access token string in the request:

::

     GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
     Authorization: Bearer 7Fjfp0ZBr1KtDRbnfVdmIw


while the **"mac"** token type defined in [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac] is
utilized by issuing a MAC key together with the access token 
which is used to sign certain components of the HTTP requests:

::

     GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
     Authorization: MAC id="h480djs93hd8",
                        nonce="274312:dj83hs9s",
                        mac="kDZvddkndxvhGRXZhvuDjEWhGeE="

The above examples are provided for illustration purposes only.

Developers are advised to consult the [:doc:`I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-bearer <bearer>`] and
[I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac] specifications before use.

Each access token type definition specifies the additional attributes
(if any) sent to the client together with the ":term:`access_token`" response parameter.  

It also defines the HTTP authentication method used to
include the :term:`access token` when making a :term:`protected resource request`.

.. note::
    - v22
    - OAuth only specify that access_token with token_type MUST be given to the protected resource endpoint.
