2.3. Client Authentication
------------------------------------

If the client type is confidential, 
the client and authorization
server establish a client authentication method suitable for the
security requirements of the authorization server.  The authorization
server MAY accept any form of client authentication meeting its
security requirements.

Confidential clients are typically issued (or establish) a set of
client credentials used for authenticating with the authorization
server (e.g., password, public/private key pair).

The authorization server MAY establish a client authentication method
with public clients.  
However, the authorization server MUST NOT rely on public client authentication 
for the purpose of identifying the client.

The client MUST NOT use more than one authentication method in each request.

.. note::
    - Basic authentication MUST be support :ref:`oauth.2.3.1`.
    - OpenID Connect documents client authentication in :doc:`discvoery`.
