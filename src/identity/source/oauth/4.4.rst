4.4. Client Credentials Grant
---------------------------------------

.. note::
    - Token Endpoint に直接トークンをリクエストします
    - User主導のGrant取得フローはなく、Client Credentialが正しければトークンを発行します。
    - Refresh Tokenの概念はないので、古くなったら再度新しいトークンを要求します。

The client can request an access token 
using only its client credentials 
(or other supported means of authentication) 
when the client is requesting access to the protected resources 
under its control, 
or those of another resource owner that have been previously
arranged with the authorization server 
(the method of which is beyond the scope of this specification).


The client credentials grant type MUST only be used by confidential clients.

                     Figure 6: Client Credentials Flow

The flow illustrated in Figure 6 includes the following steps:

   (A)  The client authenticates with the authorization server and
        requests an access token from the token endpoint.

   (B)  The authorization server authenticates the client, and if valid,
        issues an access token.
