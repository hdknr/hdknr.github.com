10.8.  Request Confidentiality
---------------------------------------

   Access tokens, refresh tokens, resource owner passwords, and client
   credentials MUST NOT be transmitted in the clear.  Authorization
   codes SHOULD NOT be transmitted in the clear.

   The "state" and "scope" parameters SHOULD NOT include sensitive
   client or resource owner information in plain text, as they can be
   transmitted over insecure channels or stored insecurely.
