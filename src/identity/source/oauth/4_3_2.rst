4.3.2.  Access Token Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the
following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
format in the HTTP request entity-body:

.. glossary::

   grant_type
        REQUIRED.  
        Value MUST be set to "password".

   username
        REQUIRED.  
        The resource owner username, encoded as UTF-8.

   password
        REQUIRED.  
        The resource owner password, encoded as UTF-8.

   scope
        OPTIONAL.  
        The scope of the access request as described by :ref:`Section 3.3 <oauth_3_3>` .

If the client type is :term:`confidential` or the client was issued client
credentials (or assigned other authentication requirements), the
client MUST authenticate with the authorization server as described
in :ref:`Section 3.2.1 <oauth_3_2_1>`.

For example, the client makes the following HTTP request using
transport-layer security (extra line breaks are for display purposes
only):


::

     POST /token HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8

     grant_type=password&username=johndoe&password=A3ddj3w


The authorization server MUST:

   -  require client authentication for :term:`confidential clients` 
      or for any client that was issued :term:`client credentials` 
      (or with other authentication requirements),

   -  authenticate the client if client authentication is included, and

   -  validate the resource owner password credentials.

Since this access token request utilizes the resource owner's
password, the authorization server MUST protect the endpoint against
:term:`brute force attacks` 
(e.g. using rate-limitation or generating alerts).
