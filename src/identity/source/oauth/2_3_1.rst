2.3.1.  Client Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clients in possession of a client password 
MAY use the :term:`HTTP Basic authentication scheme` 
as defined in [:term:`RFC2617`] 
to authenticate with the authorization server.  

The client identifier is encoded 
using the "**application/x-www-form-urlencoded**" 
content-type encoding method
defined by HTML 4.01 [:term:`W3C.REC-html401-19991224`] 
and the encoded value is used as the username; 
the client password is used as the password.
The :term:`authorization server` MUST support the 
:term:`HTTP Basic authentication scheme` 
for authenticating clients that were issued a client password.

For example (extra line breaks are for display purposes only):

::

     Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW


Alternatively, the authorization server MAY support including the
client credentials in the request body using the following
parameters:

.. note::
    Reuquest body in section include HTTP GET URL.

.. glossary::

   client_id
         REQUIRED.  
         The client identifier issued to the client 
         during the registration process 
         described by :ref:`Section 2.2. <oauth_2_2>`

   client_secret
         REQUIRED.  
         The client secret.  
         The client MAY omit the parameter 
         if the client secret is an empty string.

Including the client credentials in the request body 
using the two parameters is **NOT RECOMMENDED**, 
and should be limited to clients unable to directly utilize 
the HTTP Basic authentication scheme 
(or other password-based HTTP authentication schemes).  
The parameters can only be transmitted in the request body 
and MUST NOT be included in the request URI.

For example, 
requesting to refresh an access token (:ref:`Section 6 <oauth_6>`) 
using the body parameters 
(extra line breaks are for display purposes only):

::

     POST /token HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8

     grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA
     &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&client_secret=7Fjfp0ZBr1KtDRbnfVdmIw


The :term:`authorization server` MUST require TLS as described 
in :ref:`Section 1.6 <oauth_1_6>`
when sending requests using password authentication.

Since this client authentication method involves a password, 
the :term:`authorization server` MUST protect any endpoint utilizing it 
against :term:`brute force attacks`.
