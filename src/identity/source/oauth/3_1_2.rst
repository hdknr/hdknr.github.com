3.1.2. Redirection Endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After completing its interaction with the resource owner, 
the authorization server directs the resource owner's user-agent 
back to the client.  

The authorization server redirects the user-agent 
to the client's :term:`redirection endpoint` 
previously established with the authorization server 
during the :term:`client registration` process or 
when making the :term:`authorization request`.

The redirection endpoint URI MUST be an absolute URI 
as defined by [:term:`RFC3986`] section 4.3.  
The endpoint URI MAY include an "**application/x-www-form-urlencoded**" 
formatted ([:term:`W3C.REC-html401-19991224`]) query component 
([:term:`RFC3986`] section 3.4),
which MUST be retained when adding additional query parameters.  
The endpoint URI MUST NOT include a fragment component.
