3.1.1. Response Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The authorization endpoint is used by the authorization code grant
type and implicit grant type flows.  The client informs the
authorization server of the desired grant type using the following parameter:

   response_type

         REQUIRED.  The value MUST be one of "code" for requesting an
         authorization code as described by Section 4.1.1, "token" for
         requesting an access token (implicit grant) as described by
         Section 4.2.1, or a registered extension value as described by
         Section 8.4.  If the response type contains one or more space
         characters (%x20), it is interpreted as a space-delimited list
         of values, where the order of values does not matter (e.g. "a
         b" is the same as "b a").

If an authorization request is missing the "response_type" parameter,
the authorization server SHOULD return an error response as described
in Section 4.1.2.1.
