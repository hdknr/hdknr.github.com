4.1.2. Authorization Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the resource owner grants the access request, 
the authorization server issues an authorization code 
and delivers it to the client by adding the following parameters 
to the :term:`query component` of the redirection URI 
using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format:

.. node::

    - Response is Rediretion (302) 
    - Parameters are in Query Component.


.. glossary::

   code
        REQUIRED.  
        The authorization code generated by the authorization server.  
        The authorization code MUST expire shortly 
        after it is issued to mitigate the risk of leaks.  
        A maximum authorization code lifetime of **10 minutes** is RECOMMENDED.  
        The client MUST NOT use the authorization code more than **once**.  
        If an authorization code is used more than once, 
        the authorization server MUST deny the request 
        and SHOULD attempt to revoke all tokens previously issued 
        based on that authorization code.  
        The authorization code is bound to the **client identifier** and **redirection URI**.

   state
        REQUIRED if the "state" parameter was present in the client authorization request.  
        The exact value received from the client.

For example, the authorization server redirects the user-agent by
sending the following HTTP response:

::

     HTTP/1.1 302 Found
     Location: https://client.example.com/cb?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
               &state=xyz


The client SHOULD ignore unrecognized response parameters.  
The :term:`authorization code` string size is left undefined by this specification.  
The client should avoid making assumptions about code value sizes.  
The :term:`authorization server` should document the size of any value it issues.
