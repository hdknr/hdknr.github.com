2.2. Client Identifier
------------------------------------

The :term:`authorization server` issues the registered client 
a client identifier -- a unique string representing the registration
information provided by the client.  
The client identifier is not a secret; 
it is exposed to the resource owner and MUST NOT be used
alone for client authentication.  
The client identifier is unique to the authorization server.

The client identifier string size is left undefined by this specification.  
The client should avoid making assumptions about the
identifier size.  
The authorization server SHOULD document the size of any identifier it issues.
