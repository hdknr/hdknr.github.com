10.9.  Ensuring Endpoint Authenticity
-------------------------------------------------------

   In order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, the authorization
   server MUST require the use of TLS with server authentication as
   defined by [RFC2818] for any request sent to the authorization and
   token endpoints.  The client MUST validate the authorization server's
   TLS certificate as defined by [RFC6125] and in accordance with its
   requirements for server identity authentication.
