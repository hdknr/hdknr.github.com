7.1. Access Token Types
------------------------------

The :term:`access token type` provides the client 
with the information required to successfully utilize the access token 
to make a protected resource request 
(along with type-specific attributes).  

The client MUST NOT use an access token if it does not understand the token type.

For example, 
the "bearer" token type defined in :term:`[RFC6750]` is utilized
by simply including the :term:`access token` string in the request:

::

     GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
     Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM

while the "mac" token type defined in :term:`[OAuth-HTTP-MAC]` is utilized by
issuing a Message Authentication Code (MAC) key together with the access token 
that is used to sign certain components of the HTTP requests:

::

     GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
     Authorization: MAC id="h480djs93hd8",
                        nonce="274312:dj83hs9s",
                        mac="kDZvddkndxvhGRXZhvuDjEWhGeE="

The above examples are provided for illustration purposes only.

Developers are advised to consult the :term:`[RFC6750]` and :term:`[OAuth-HTTP-MAC]`
specifications before use.

Each access token type definition specifies the additional attributes
(if any) sent to the client together with the ":term:`access_token`" response parameter.  
It also defines the HTTP authentication method 
used to include the access token when making a protected resource request.
