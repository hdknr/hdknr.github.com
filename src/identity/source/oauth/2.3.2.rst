2.3.2. Other Authentication Methods


The authorization server MAY support any suitable HTTP authentication
scheme matching its security requirements.  When using other
authentication methods, the authorization server MUST define a
mapping between the client identifier (registration record) and
authentication scheme.

.. note::

    - OpenID Connect documents client authentication methods in :doc:`discovery`.
