10. Security Considerations
======================================================

As a flexible and extensible framework, OAuth's security considerations depend on many factors.  
The following sections provide implementers with security guidelines 
focused on the three client profiles described in Section 2.1: web application, 
user-agent-based application, and native application.

A comprehensive OAuth security model and analysis, 
as well as background for the protocol design is provided by [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2-threatmodel].
