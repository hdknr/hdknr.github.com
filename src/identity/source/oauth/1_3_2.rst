1.3.2.  Implicit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`implicit grant` is a simplified :term:`authorization code flow` 
optimized for clients implemented in a browser using a scripting language 
such as JavaScript.  
In the :term:`implicit flow`, 
instead of issuing the client an :term:`authorization code`, 
the :term:`client` is issued an :term:`access token` directly
(as the result of the :term:`resource owner` authorization).  
The :term:`grant type` is implicit as no intermediate credentials 
(such as an :term:`authorization code`) are issued 
(and later used to obtain an :term:`access token`).

When issuing an :term:`implicit grant`, 
the :term:`authorization server` does not authenticate the :term:`client`.  
In some cases, 
the :term:`client` identity can be verified via the :term:`redirection URI` 
used to deliver the :term:`access token` to the :term:`client`.  
The :term:`access token` may be exposed to the :term:`resource owner` or
other applications with access to the :term:`resource owner`'s user-agent.

Implicit grants improve the responsiveness and efficiency of some clients 
(such as a client implemented as an in-browser application)
since it reduces the number of round trips required to obtain an :term:`access token`.  
However, 
this convenience should be weighed against the security implications of using implicit grants, 
especially when the authorization code grant type is available.
