4.2.2. Access Token Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the resource owner grants the access request, 
the authorization server issues an access token and delivers it 
to the client by adding the following parameters 
to the fragment component of the redirection URI 
using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format:

.. glossary::

   access_token
         REQUIRED.  
         The access token issued by the authorization server.

   token_type
         REQUIRED.  The type of the token issued as described in
         Section 7.1.  Value is case insensitive.

   expires_in
         OPTIONAL.  The lifetime in seconds of the access token.  For
         example, the value "3600" denotes that the access token will
         expire in one hour from the time the response was generated.

   scope
         OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access token as described by :ref:`Section 3.3 <oauth_3_3>`.

   state
         REQUIRED if the "state" parameter was present in the client
         authorization request.  The exact value received from the
         client.

The authorization server MUST NOT issue a :term:`refresh token`. [#]_

.. [#] Tokens MUST NOT be returned in URL query part. 
       Are there any method to return access_token + refresh_token in fragment ?
    
For example, 
the authorization server redirects the user-agent 
by sending the following HTTP response (URI extra line breaks are for display purposes only):

:: 

     HTTP/1.1 302 Found
     Location: http://example.com/rd#access_token=2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA
               &state=xyz&token_type=example&expires_in=3600


Developers should note that 
some HTTP client implementations do not support the inclusion of a fragment component 
in the HTTP "Location" response header field.  
Such client will require using other methods for redirecting the client 
than a 3xx redirection response.  
For example, returning an HTML page which includes a 'continue' button 
with an action linked to the redirection URI.

.. todo::
    What browser can't handle URL fragemnt component in Location response header?

The client SHOULD ignore unrecognized response parameters.  
The access token string size is left undefined by this specification.
The client should avoid making assumptions about value sizes.  
The authorization server should document the size of any value it issues.
