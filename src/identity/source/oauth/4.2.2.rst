4.2.2. Access Token Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the resource owner grants the access request, the authorization
server issues an access token and delivers it to the client by adding
the following parameters to the fragment component of the redirection
URI using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format, per
Appendix B:

.. glossary::

    access_token
          REQUIRED.  The access token issued by the authorization server.
    
    token_type
          REQUIRED.  The type of the token issued as described in
          Section 7.1.  Value is case insensitive.
    
    expires_in
          RECOMMENDED.  The lifetime in seconds of the access token.  For
          example, the value "3600" denotes that the access token will
          expire in one hour from the time the response was generated.
          If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the
          expiration time via other means or document the default value.
    
    scope
          OPTIONAL, if identical to the scope requested by the client;
          otherwise, REQUIRED.  The scope of the access token as
          described by Section 3.3.
    
    state
          REQUIRED if the "state" parameter was present in the client
          authorization request.  The exact value received from the
          client.

The authorization server MUST NOT issue a refresh token.

For example, the authorization server redirects the user-agent by
sending the following HTTP response (with extra line breaks for
display purposes only):

::

  HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: http://example.com/cb#access_token=2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA
            &state=xyz&token_type=example&expires_in=3600

Developers should note that some user-agents do not support the
inclusion of a fragment component in the HTTP "Location" response
header field.  Such clients will require using other methods for
redirecting the client than a 3xx redirection response -- for
example, returning an HTML page that includes a 'continue' button
with an action linked to the redirection URI.

The client MUST ignore unrecognized response parameters.  The access
token string size is left undefined by this specification.  The
client should avoid making assumptions about value sizes.  The
authorization server SHOULD document the size of any value it issues.
