2.2.  Client Identifier
------------------------------

The :term:`authorization server` issues the registered :term:`client` 
a :term:`client identifier` 
- a unique string representing the registration information provided by the client.  

The client identifier is not a secret, 
it is exposed to the :term:`resource owner`, 
and MUST NOT be used alone for :term:`client authentication`.
