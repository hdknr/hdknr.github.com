4.1.  Authorization Code Grant
-------------------------------------------------------

The :term:`authorization code grant` type is used to obtain 
both :term:`access tokens` and :term:`refresh tokens` 
and is optimized for :term:`confidential clients`.

As a redirection-based flow, 
the client must be capable of interacting with the resource owner's user-agent 
(typically a web browser) 
and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
from the authorization server.

     Note: The lines illustrating steps A, B, and C are broken into two
     parts as they pass through the user-agent.


                     Figure 3: Authorization Code Flow

The flow illustrated in Figure 3 includes the following steps:

   (A)  The client initiates the flow by directing the resource owner's
        user-agent to the authorization endpoint.  The client includes
        its client identifier, requested scope, local state, and a
        redirection URI to which the authorization server will send the
        user-agent back once access is granted (or denied).

   (B)  The authorization server authenticates the resource owner (via
        the user-agent) and establishes whether the resource owner
        grants or denies the client's access request.

   (C)  Assuming the resource owner grants access, the authorization
        server redirects the user-agent back to the client using the
        redirection URI provided earlier (in the request or during
        client registration).  The redirection URI includes an
        authorization code and any local state provided by the client
        earlier.

   (D)  The client requests an access token from the authorization
        server's token endpoint by including the authorization code
        received in the previous step.  When making the request, the
        client authenticates with the authorization server.  The client
        includes the redirection URI used to obtain the authorization
        code for verification.

   (E)  The authorization server authenticates the client, validates the
        authorization code, and ensures the redirection URI received
        matches the URI used to redirect the client in step (C).  If
        valid, the authorization server responds back with an access
        token and optionally, a refresh token.
