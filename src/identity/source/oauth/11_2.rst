11.2.  The OAuth Parameters Registry
------------------------------------------------------------

This specification establishes the OAuth parameters registry.

Additional parameters for inclusion in 
the :term:`authorization endpoint request`, 
the :term:`authorization endpoint response`, 
the :term:`token endpoint request`, or 
the :term:`token endpoint response` are registered 
on the advice of one or more :term:`Designated Experts` 
(appointed by the IESG or their delegate), 
with a :term:`Specification Required` (using terminology from [:term:`RFC5226`]).  

However, 
to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication, 
the :term:`Designated Expert(s) <Designated Experts>` may approve registration 
once they are satisfied that such a specification will be published.

Registration requests should be sent to the **[TBD]@ietf.org** mailing list 
for review and comment, 
with an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request for parameter: example"). 
[[ Note to RFC-EDITOR: 
The name of the mailing list should be determined in consultation 
with the :term:`IESG` and :term:`IANA`.  
Suggested name: **oauth-ext-review**. ]]

Within at most 14 days of the request, the 
Designated Expert(s) will either approve 
or deny the registration request, 
communicating this decision to the review list and :term:`IANA`.  
Denials should include an explanation and, 
if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.

Decisions (or lack thereof) made by the Designated Expert(s) 
can be first appealed to :term:`Application Area Directors` 
(contactable using app-ads@tools.ietf.org email address 
or directly by looking up their email addresses on http://www.iesg.org/ website) 
and, if the appellant is not satisfied with the response, 
to the full :term:`IESG` (using the iesg@iesg.org mailing list).

:term:`IANA` should only accept registry updates from the Designated Expert(s), 
and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing list.
