8.4. Defining New Authorization Endpoint Response Types
------------------------------------------------------------------------

New :term:`response types` for use with the :term:`authorization endpoint`
are defined and registered in the :term:`authorization endpoint response type registry`
following the procedure in :ref:`Section 11.3 <oauth_11_3>`.  
:term:`Response type names` MUST conform to the response-type :term:`ABNF`.

::

     response-type  = response-name *( SP response-name )
     response-name  = 1*response-char
     response-char  = "_" / DIGIT / ALPHA


If a :term:`response type` contains one of more space characters (%x20), 
it is compared as a space-delimited list of values 
in which the order of values does not matter.  
Only one order of values can be registered, 
which covers all other arrangements of the same set of values.

For example, 
the response type "token code" is left undefined by this specification.  
However, 
an extension can define and register the "token code" response type.  
Once registered, 
the same combination cannot be registered as "code token", 
but both values can be used to denote the same response type.
