4.5.  Extensions
----------------------------------------

The client uses an extension :term:`grant type` by specifying the grant type
using an absolute URI (defined by the authorization server) 
as the value of the ":term:`grant_type`" parameter of the :term:`token endpoint`, 
and by adding any additional parameters necessary.

For example, 
to request an access token using a SAML 2.0 assertion grant type 
as defined by [I-D.ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer], 
the client makes the following HTTP request using transport-layer security 
(line breaks are for display purposes only):

::

     POST /token HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8

     grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Asaml2-
     bearer&assertion=PEFzc2VydGlvbiBJc3N1ZUluc3RhbnQ9IjIwMTEtMDU
     [...omitted for brevity...]aG5TdGF0ZW1lbnQ-PC9Bc3NlcnRpb24-


If the access token request is valid and authorized, 
the :term:`authorization server` issues an access token and optional refresh token 
as described in :ref:`Section 5.1 <oauth_5_1>`.  
If the request failed client authentication or is invalid, 
the authorization server returns an error response as described in :ref:`Section 5.2 <oauth_5_2>`.
