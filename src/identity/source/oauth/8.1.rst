8.1.  Defining Access Token Types
---------------------------------------

Access token types can be defined in one of two ways: registered in
the Access Token Types registry (following the procedures in
Section 11.1), or by using a unique absolute URI as its name.

Types utilizing a URI name SHOULD be limited to vendor-specific
implementations that are not commonly applicable, and are specific to
the implementation details of the resource server where they are
used.

All other types MUST be registered.  Type names MUST conform to the
type-name ABNF.  If the type definition includes a new HTTP
authentication scheme, the type name SHOULD be identical to the HTTP
authentication scheme name (as defined by [RFC2617]).  The token type
"example" is reserved for use in examples.

     name-char  = "-" / "." / "_" / DIGIT / ALPHA
