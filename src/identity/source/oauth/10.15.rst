10.15.  Open Redirectors
------------------------------------------

   The authorization server, authorization endpoint, and client
   redirection endpoint can be improperly configured and operate as open
   redirectors.  An open redirector is an endpoint using a parameter to
   automatically redirect a user-agent to the location specified by the
   parameter value without any validation.

   Open redirectors can be used in phishing attacks, or by an attacker
   to get end-users to visit malicious sites by using the URI authority
   component of a familiar and trusted destination.  In addition, if the
   authorization server allows the client to register only part of the
   redirection URI, an attacker can use an open redirector operated by
   the client to construct a redirection URI that will pass the
   authorization server validation but will send the authorization code
   or access token to an endpoint under the control of the attacker.
