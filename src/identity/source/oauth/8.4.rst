8.4.  Defining New Authorization Endpoint Response Types
---------------------------------------------------------------

New response types for use with the authorization endpoint are
defined and registered in the Authorization Endpoint Response Types
registry following the procedure in Section 11.3.  Response type
names MUST conform to the response-type ABNF.

::
     response-type  = response-name *( SP response-name )
     response-name  = 1*response-char
     response-char  = "_" / DIGIT / ALPHA

If a response type contains one or more space characters (%x20), it
is compared as a space-delimited list of values in which the order of
values does not matter.  Only one order of values can be registered,
which covers all other arrangements of the same set of values.

For example, the response type "token code" is left undefined by this
specification.  However, an extension can define and register the
"token code" response type.  Once registered, the same combination
cannot be registered as "code token", but both values can be used to
denote the same response type.
