6.  Refreshing an Access Token
=======================================

If the :term:`authorization server` issued a :term:`refresh token` to the client, 
the client makes a refresh request to the :term:`token endpoint` 
by adding the following parameters 
using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format in the HTTP request entity-body:

.. glossary::

   grant_type
        REQUIRED.  
        Value MUST be set to "**refresh_token**".

   refresh_token
        REQUIRED.  
        The refresh token issued to the client.

   scope
        OPTIONAL.  
        The scope of the access request as described by :ref:`Section 3.3 <oauth_3_3>`.  
        The requested scope MUST NOT include any scope 
        not originally granted by the resource owner, 
        and if omitted is treated as equal to the scope originally granted by the :term:`resource owner`.

Because refresh tokens are typically **long-lasting credentials** 
used to request additional access tokens, 
the refresh token is bound to the client it was issued.  

If the client type is :term:`confidential` or the client was issued client credentials 
(or assigned other authentication requirements), 
the client MUST authenticate with the :term:`authorization server` 
as described in :ref:`Section 3.2.1 <oauth_3_2_1>`.

For example, the client makes the following HTTP request 
using transport-layer security 
(extra line breaks are for display purposes only): ::

     POST /token HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8

     grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA


The :term:`authorization server` MUST:

   -  require **client authentication** 
      for :term:`confidential clients` 
      or for any client that was issued :term:`client credentials` 
      (or with other authentication requirements),

   -  authenticate the client if client authentication is included and
      ensure the refresh token was issued to the authenticated client,
      and

   -  validate the refresh token.

If valid and authorized, the authorization server issues an access
token as described in :ref:`Section 5.1 <oauth_5_1>`.  
If the request failed verification or is invalid, 
the authorization server returns an error response as described in :ref:`Section 5.2 <oauth_5_2>`.

The authorization server MAY issue a new refresh token, 
in which case the client MUST **discard the old refresh token** 
and replace it with the new refresh token.  

The authorization server MAY revoke the old refresh token 
after issuing a new refresh token to the client.  
If a new refresh token is issued, 
the refresh token scope MUST be identical to that of the refresh token 
included by the client in the request.
