3.1.2.5. Endpoint Content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
    - NO 3rd party script or others in HTML of redirect_uri

The redirection request to the client's endpoint typically results in
an HTML document response, processed by the user-agent.  
If the HTML response is served directly as the result of the redirection request,
any script included in the HTML document will execute with full
access to the redirection URI and the credentials it contains.

The client SHOULD NOT include any third-party scripts 
(e.g., third-party analytics, social plug-ins, ad networks) 
in the redirection endpoint response.  

Instead, 
it SHOULD extract the credentials from the URI and redirect the user-agent 
again to another endpoint without exposing the credentials (in the URI or elsewhere).  
If third-party scripts are included, 
the client MUST ensure that its own scripts 
(used to extract and remove the credentials from the URI) will execute first.
