3.1.2.5.  Endpoint Content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The redirection request to the client's endpoint typically results in
an HTML document response, processed by the user-agent.  If the HTML
response is served directly as the result of the redirection request,
any script included in the HTML document will execute with full
access to the redirection URI and the credentials it contains.

The client MUST NOT include any untrusted third-party scripts in the
redirection endpoint response (e.g. third-party analytics, social
plug-ins, ad networks) without first ensuring that its own scripts
used to extract and remove the credentials from the URI will execute
first.


The client SHOULD NOT include any third-party scripts in the
redirection endpoint response.  Instead, it should extract the
credentials from the URI and redirect the user-agent again to another
endpoint without the credentials in the URI.

    Developer MSUT provide a dedicated master template for 
    the redirection URL contents.
