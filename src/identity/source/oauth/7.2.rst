7.2. Error Response
----------------------------------------

If a resource access request fails, the resource server SHOULD inform
the client of the error.  While the specifics of such error responses
are beyond the scope of this specification, this document establishes
a common registry in :ref:`Section 11.4 <oauth.11.4>` 
for error values to be shared among OAuth token authentication schemes.

New authentication schemes designed primarily for OAuth token
authentication SHOULD define a mechanism for providing an error
status code to the client, in which the error values allowed are
registered in the error registry established by this specification.

Such schemes MAY limit the set of valid error codes to a subset of
the registered values.  If the error code is returned using a named
parameter, the parameter name SHOULD be "error".

Other schemes capable of being used for OAuth token authentication,
but not primarily designed for that purpose, MAY bind their error
values to the registry in the same manner.

New authentication schemes MAY choose to also specify the use of the
"error_description" and "error_uri" parameters to return error
information in a manner parallel to their usage in this specification.
