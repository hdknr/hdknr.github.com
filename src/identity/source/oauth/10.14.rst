10.14.  Code Injection and Input Validation
----------------------------------------------------

   A code injection attack occurs when an input or otherwise external
   variable is used by an application unsanitized and causes
   modification to the application logic.  This may allow an attacker to
   gain access to the application device or its data, cause denial of
   service, or introduce a wide range of malicious side-effects.

   The authorization server and client MUST sanitize (and validate when
   possible) any value received -- in particular, the value of the
   "state" and "redirect_uri" parameters.
