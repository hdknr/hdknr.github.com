1.5. Refresh Token
--------------------------------

Refresh tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens.  
Refresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server and 
are used to obtain a new access token 
when the current access token becomes invalid or expires, 
or to obtain additional access tokens with identical or narrower scope 
(access tokens may have a shorter lifetime and fewer permissions 
than authorized by the resource owner).  
Issuing a refresh token is optional at the discretion of the authorization server.  
If the authorization server issues a refresh token, 
it is included when issuing an access token (i.e., step (D) in Figure 1).

.. note::

    - refresh token -> access token
    - refresh token support is OPTIONAL.

A refresh token is a string representing the authorization granted to
the client by the resource owner.  The string is usually opaque to
the client.  The token denotes an identifier used to retrieve the
authorization information.  Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are
intended for use only with authorization servers and are never sent
to resource servers.

               Figure 2: Refreshing an Expired Access Token

The flow illustrated in Figure 2 includes the following steps:

   (A)  The client requests an access token by authenticating with the
        authorization server and presenting an authorization grant.

   (B)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the authorization grant, and if valid, issues an access token
        and a refresh token.

   (C)  The client makes a protected resource request to the resource
        server by presenting the access token.

   (D)  The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
        serves the request.

   (E)  Steps (C) and (D) repeat until the access token expires.  If the
        client knows the access token expired, it skips to step (G);
        otherwise, it makes another protected resource request.

   (F)  Since the access token is invalid, the resource server returns
        an invalid token error.


   (G)  The client requests a new access token by authenticating with
        the authorization server and presenting the refresh token.  The
        client authentication requirements are based on the client type
        and on the authorization server policies.

   (H)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the refresh token, and if valid, issues a new access token (and,
        optionally, a new refresh token).

Steps (C), (D), (E), and (F) are outside the scope of this
specification, as described in :ref:`Section 7 <oauth.7>`.
