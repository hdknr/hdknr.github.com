3.1.2. Redirection Endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. node:
    1. registration
    2. authorization reuqest
    
    - absolute URI (:rfc:`3986` )
    - **NO** fragment ( クエリは入れてもいいけど、フラグメントは無し )

After completing its interaction with the :term:`resource owner`, 
the :term:`authorization server` directs the resource owner's user-agent 
back to the client.  

The authorization server redirects the user-agent 
to the client's :term:`redirection endpoint` 
previously established with the authorization server 
during the :term:`client registration` process 
or when making the :term:`authorization request`.

The redirection endpoint URI MUST be an absolute URI 
as defined by :term:`[RFC3986]` Section 4.3.  
The endpoint URI MAY include an "**application/x-www-form-urlencoded**" formatted 
(per Appendix B) query component (:term:`[RFC3986]` Section 3.4), 
which MUST be retained when adding additional query parameters.  

The endpoint URI MUST NOT include a fragment component.
