7. Accessing Protected Resources
=========================================


The client accesses protected resources by presenting the :term:`access token` to the resource server.  
The resource server MUST validate the access token and ensure it has not expired 
and that its scope covers the requested resource.  

The methods used by the resource server to validate the access token (as well as any error responses) are beyond the scope of this specification, 
but generally involve an interaction or coordination between the resource server and the authorization server.

The method in which the client utilized the access token to authenticate with the resource server 
depends on the type of access token issued by the authorization server.  
Typically, it involves using the HTTP "Authorization" request header field [:rfc:`2617`] 
with an authentication scheme defined by the access token type specification.
