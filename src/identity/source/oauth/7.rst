7. Accessing Protected Resources
=========================================

The client accesses :term:`protected resources` 
by presenting the :term:`access token` to the :term:`resource server`.  

The resource server MUST **validate** the access token 
and ensure that it has **not expired** 
and that its :term:`scope` covers the requested resource.  

The methods used by the resource server to validate the access token 
(as well as any error responses) are beyond the scope of this specification 
but generally involve an interaction or coordination 
between the resource server and the authorization server.

.. note::
    - :doc:`uma_core`

The method in which the client utilizes the access token to
authenticate with the resource server 
depends on the **type of access token** issued by the authorization server.  

Typically, 
it involves using the HTTP "**Authorization**" request header field :term:`[RFC2617]` 
with an authentication scheme defined by the specification of the access
token type used, such as :term:`[RFC6750]`.
