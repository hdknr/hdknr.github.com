4.1.2. Authorization Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the resource owner grants the access request, the authorization
server issues an authorization code and delivers it to the client by
adding the following parameters to the query component of the
redirection URI using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format,
per Appendix B:

.. glossary::

    code
          REQUIRED.  The authorization code generated by the
          authorization server.  The authorization code MUST expire
          shortly after it is issued to mitigate the risk of leaks.  A
          maximum authorization code lifetime of 10 minutes is
          RECOMMENDED.  The client MUST NOT use the authorization code
          more than once.  If an authorization code is used more than
          once, the authorization server MUST deny the request and SHOULD
          revoke (when possible) all tokens previously issued based on
          that authorization code.  The authorization code is bound to
          the client identifier and redirection URI.
    
    state
          REQUIRED if the "state" parameter was present in the client
          authorization request.  The exact value received from the
          client.

For example, the authorization server redirects the user-agent by
sending the following HTTP response:

:: 

  HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: https://client.example.com/cb?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
            &state=xyz

The client MUST ignore unrecognized response parameters.  The
authorization code string size is left undefined by this
specification.  The client should avoid making assumptions about code
value sizes.  The authorization server SHOULD document the size of
any value it issues.
