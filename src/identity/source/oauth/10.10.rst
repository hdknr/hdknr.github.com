10.10.  Credentials-Guessing Attacks
----------------------------------------------

The authorization server MUST prevent attackers 
from guessing access tokens, authorization codes, refresh tokens, 
resource owner passwords, and client credentials.

The probability of an attacker guessing generated tokens 
(and other credentials not intended for handling by end-users) 
MUST be less than or equal to 2^(-128) and SHOULD be less than 
or equal to 2^(-160).

The authorization server MUST utilize other means 
to protect credentials intended for end-user usage.
