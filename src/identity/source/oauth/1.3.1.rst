1.3.1.  Authorization Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server
as an intermediary between the client and resource owner.  Instead of
requesting authorization directly from the resource owner, the client
directs the resource owner to an authorization server (via its
user-agent as defined in :term:`[RFC2616]`), which in turn directs the
resource owner back to the client with the authorization code.

Before directing the resource owner back to the client with the
authorization code, the authorization server authenticates the
resource owner and obtains authorization.  Because the resource owner
only authenticates with the authorization server, the resource
owner's credentials are never shared with the client.


.. note::

    - user authentication before code response

The authorization code provides a few important security benefits,
such as the ability to authenticate the client, as well as the
transmission of the access token directly to the client without
passing it through the resource owner's user-agent and potentially
exposing it to others, including the resource owner.
