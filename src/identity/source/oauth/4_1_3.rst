4.1.3.  Access Token Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The client makes a request to the :term:`token endpoint` 
by adding the following parameters 
using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format 
in the HTTP request entity-body:

.. glossary::

   grant_type
         REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "authorization_code".

   code
         REQUIRED.  The authorization code received from the
         authorization server.

   redirect_uri
         REQUIRED, if the "redirect_uri" parameter was included in the
         authorization request as described in Section 4.1.1, and their
         values MUST be identical.

If the :term:`client type` is :term:`confidential` 
or the client was issued :term:`client credentials` 
(or assigned other authentication requirements), 
the client MUST authenticate with the authorization server as described 
in :ref:`Section 3.2.1 <oauth_3_2_1>`.

For example, 
the client makes the following HTTP request using TLS
(extra line breaks are for display purposes only):

::

     POST /token HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com
     Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8

     grant_type=authorization_code&code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
     &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb


The authorization server MUST:

   -  require client authentication for confidential clients or for any
      client that was issued client credentials (or with other
      authentication requirements),

   -  authenticate the client if client authentication is included and
      ensure the authorization code was issued to the authenticated
      client,

   -  verify that the authorization code is valid, and

   -  ensure that the "redirect_uri" parameter is present if the
      "redirect_uri" parameter was included in the initial authorization
      request as described in Section 4.1.1, and if included ensure
      their values are identical.
