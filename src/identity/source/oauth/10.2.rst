10.2.  Client Impersonation
------------------------------------

   A malicious client can impersonate another client and obtain access
   to protected resources if the impersonated client fails to, or is
   unable to, keep its client credentials confidential.

   The authorization server MUST authenticate the client whenever
   possible.  If the authorization server cannot authenticate the client
   due to the client's nature, the authorization server MUST require the
   registration of any redirection URI used for receiving authorization
   responses and SHOULD utilize other means to protect resource owners
   from such potentially malicious clients.  For example, the
   authorization server can engage the resource owner to assist in
   identifying the client and its origin.

   The authorization server SHOULD enforce explicit resource owner
   authentication and provide the resource owner with information about
   the client and the requested authorization scope and lifetime.  It is
   up to the resource owner to review the information in the context of
   the current client and to authorize or deny the request.

   The authorization server SHOULD NOT process repeated authorization
   requests automatically (without active resource owner interaction)
   without authenticating the client or relying on other measures to
   ensure that the repeated request comes from the original client and
   not an impersonator.
