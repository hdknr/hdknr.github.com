4.4.  Client Credentials
------------------------------

.. note::
    (Confidential) Client can get  access tokens at Token Endpoint by presenting its credential. 

The :term:`client` can request an :term:`access token` 
using only its client credentials 
(or other supported means of authentication) 
when the :term:`client` is requesting access to the :term:`protected resources` 
under its control, or those of another resource owner 
which has been previously arranged with the :term:`authorization server` 
(the method of which is beyond the scope of this specification).

The :term:`client credentials grant type` MUST only be used by :term:`confidential clients`.

                     Figure 6: Client Credentials Flow

The flow illustrated in Figure 6 includes the following steps:

   (A)  The :term:`client` authenticates with the :term:`authorization server` and
        requests an :term:`access token` from the :term:`token endpoint`.

   (B)  The :term:`authorization server` authenticates the :term:`client`, 
        and if valid issues an :term:`access token`.
