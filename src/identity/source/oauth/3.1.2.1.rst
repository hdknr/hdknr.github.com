3.1.2.1. Endpoint Request Confidentiality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    - TLS
    - otherwise NOTICE to the resource owner

The redirection endpoint SHOULD require the use of TLS 
as described in :ref:`Section 1.6 <oauth.1.6>` 
when the requested response type is "code" or "token",
or when the redirection request will result in the transmission of sensitive credentials over an open network.  

This specification does not mandate the use of TLS 
because at the time of this writing, requiring clients to deploy TLS is a significant hurdle 
for many client developers.  
If TLS is not available, 
the authorization server SHOULD warn the resource owner 
about the insecure endpoint prior to redirection 
(e.g., display a message during the authorization request).

Lack of transport-layer security can have a severe impact on the
security of the client and the protected resources it is authorized
to access.  The use of transport-layer security is particularly
critical when the authorization process is used as a form of
delegated end-user authentication by the client (e.g., third-party
sign-in service).
