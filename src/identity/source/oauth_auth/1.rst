1.  Introduction
========================================

:ref:`Section 4.1 of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework <oauth.4.1>` [RFC6749]
defines the "Authorization Code Grant" flow which defines a redirect
flow, typically via a web browser, that enables confidential clients
to obtain access and refresh tokens.  As part of this flow, resource
owners are authenticated via the user agent so that their consent may
be obtained.  This flow defines the "Authentication Code Grant"
extension which enables clients to request re-authentication and
makes authentication session information available to the client in a
standardized format.

This document focuses on extending OAuth2 to provide authentication
session information only.  The specification does not define a
standardized resource owner profile information API.  It is assumed
that other APIs such as the SCIM API [I-D.ietf-scim-api] or Open
Identity Connect [OIDC] could be used for this purpose.  As part of
the session information, a subject profile URL may optionally be
provided.
