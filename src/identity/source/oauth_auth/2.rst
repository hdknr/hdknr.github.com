2.  Authenticate Code Grant
====================================

The :term:`Authentication Code Grant` type is used in exactly the same manor
as the Authorization Code Grant :ref:`Section 4.1 <oauth.4.1>` [RFC6749] 
and has the same features and conditions.  

The Authorization Code Grant extends the features available 
by making it possible for clients to test and request re-authenticaiton 
and authorization as well as obtain login session information 
at the end of the grant flow.
