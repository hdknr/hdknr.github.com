2.3.  Access Token Request
------------------------------------

The access token request is identical to the one described in :ref:`Section 4.1.3 <oauth.4.1.3>` [RFC6749].  
In cases where there is no associated resource API and an access token is not to be issued, 
the normal OAuth2 token request is still made.
