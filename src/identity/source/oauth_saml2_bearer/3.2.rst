3.2.  Client Authentication Processing
------------------------------------------------

If the client Assertion is not valid, 
or its subject confirmation requirements cannot be met, 
the authorization server MUST construct an error response as defined in [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].  
The value of the error parameter MUST be the "invalid_client" error code.  
The authorization server MAY include additional information 
regarding the reasons the Assertion was considered invalid 
using the error_description or error_uri parameters.
