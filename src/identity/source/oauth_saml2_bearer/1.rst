1.  Introduction
================================================

The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] 
is an XML-based framework that allows identity and security information 
to be shared across security domains.  
The SAML specification, 
while primarily targeted at providing cross domain Web browser single sign-on, 
was also designed to be modular and extensible to facilitate use in other contexts.

The :term:`Assertion`, an :term:`XML security token`, 
is a fundamental construct of SAML that is often adopted for use 
in other protocols and specifications.  
An Assertion is generally issued by an identity provider 
and consumed by a service provider 
who relies on its content 
to identify the Assertion's subject for security related purposes.

The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2] provides a
method for making authenticated HTTP requests to a resource using an
access token.  Access tokens are issued to third-party clients by an
authorization server (AS) with the (sometimes implicit) approval of
the resource owner.  In OAuth, an authorization grant is an abstract
term used to describe intermediate credentials that represent the
resource owner authorization.  An authorization grant is used by the
client to obtain an access token.  Several authorization grant types
are defined to support a wide range of client types and user
experiences.  OAuth also allows for the definition of new extension
grant types to support additional clients or to provide a bridge
between OAuth and other trust frameworks.  Finally, OAuth allows the
definition of additional authentication mechanisms to be used by
clients when interacting with the authorization server.

The OAuth 2.0 Assertion Profile [I-D.ietf.oauth-assertions] is an
abstract extension to OAuth 2.0 that provides a general framework for
the use of assertions as client credentials and/or authorization
grants with OAuth 2.0.  This specification profiles the OAuth 2.0
Assertion Profile [I-D.ietf.oauth-assertions] to define an extension
grant type that uses a SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion to request an OAuth
2.0 access token as well as for use as client credentials.  The
format and processing rules for the SAML Assertion defined in this
specification are intentionally similar, though not identical, to
those in the Web Browser SSO Profile defined in SAML Profiles
[OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os].  This specification is reusing, to the
extent reasonable, concepts and patterns from that well-established
Profile.

This document defines 
how a :term:`SAML Assertion` can be used to request an :term:`access token` 
when a client wishes to utilize an existing trust relationship, 
expressed through the semantics of 
(and digital signature calculated over) the SAML Assertion, 
without a direct user approval step at the authorization server.  
It also defines how a :term:`SAML Assertion` can be used 
as a :term:`client authentication` mechanism.  
The use of an :term:`Assertion` for :term:`client authentication` is orthogonal 
and separable from using an :term:`Assertion` as an :term:`authorization grant` 
and the two can be used either in combination or in isolation.

The process by which the client obtains the :term:`SAML Assertion`, prior to
exchanging it with the authorization server or using it for client
authentication, is out of scope.
