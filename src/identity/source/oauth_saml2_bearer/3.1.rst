3.1.  Authorization Grant Processing
----------------------------------------------------

If present, the :term:`authorization server` MUST also validate 
the :term:`client credentials`.

:term:`Authorization servers` SHOULD issue :term:`access tokens` with a limited
lifetime and require clients to refresh them by requesting a new :term:`access token` 
using the same :term:`assertion`, 
if it is still valid, or with a new :term:`assertion`.  
The :term:`authorization server` SHOULD NOT issue a :term:`refresh token`.

.. note::
    No refresh token!


If the :term:`Assertion` is not valid, or its subject confirmation
requirements cannot be met, 
the :term:`authorization server` MUST construct an error response 
as defined in [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].  

The value of the error parameter MUST be the "invalid_grant" error code.  
The :term:`authorization server` MAY include additional information 
regarding the reasons the :term:`Assertion` was considered invalid 
using the :term:`error_description` or :term:`error_uri` parameters.

For example:

::

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "error":"invalid_grant",
     "error_description":"Audience validation failed"
   }
