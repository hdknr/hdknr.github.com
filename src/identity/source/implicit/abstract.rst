Abstract
====================

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer 
on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. 
It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User 
based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, 
as well as to obtain basic profile information 
about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

OpenID Connect Implicit Client Profile 1.0 is 
a profile of the OpenID Connect Messages 1.0 
and OpenID Connect Standard 1.0 specifications that is designed 
to be easy to read and implement for basic Web-based Relying Parties 
using the OAuth implicit grant type. 
This specification intentionally duplicates content from the Messages and Standard specifications 
to provide a self-contained implementation profile 
for basic Web-based Relying Parties using the OAuth implicit grant type.

OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications should instead consult the Messages and Standard specifications.
