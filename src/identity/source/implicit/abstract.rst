Abstract
============================

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

This OpenID Connect Implicit Client Implementer's Guide 1.0 contains a subset of the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification that is designed to be easy to read and implement for basic Web-based Relying Parties using the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow. This specification intentionally duplicates content from the Core specification to provide a self-contained implementer's guide for basic Web-based Relying Parties using the OAuth Implicit Flow.

OpenID Providers and non-Web-based applications should instead consult the Core specification.
