2.  Protocol Elements
=======================================

Authentication Requests can follow one of three paths: the Authorization Code Flow, the Implicit Flow, or the Hybrid Flow. The Authorization Code Flow is intended for Clients that can securely maintain a Client Secret between themselves and the Authorization Server, whereas the Implicit Flow is intended for Clients that cannot. However, the Authorization Code flow is sometimes also used by Native applications and other Clients in order to be able to obtain a Refresh Token, even when they cannot ensure the secrecy of the Client Secret value. The Hybrid Flow combines aspects of the Authorization Code Flow and the Implicit Flow. It enables Clients to obtain an ID Token optionally an Access Token with only one round trip to the Authorization Server, possibly minimizing latency, while still enabling Clients to later get tokens from the Token Endpoint -- especially a Refresh Token.

This specification only provides information that is sufficient for basic Clients using the Implicit Flow.
