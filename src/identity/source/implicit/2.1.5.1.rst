2.1.5.1.  End-User Grants Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the :term:`Resource Owner` grants the access request, 
the :term:`Authorization Server` issues an :term:`Access Token` 
and delivers it to the :term:`Client` 
by adding the following parameters 
to the :term:`fragment component` of the :term:`redirection URI` 
using the **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** format 
as defined in :ref:`Section 4.2.2 of OAuth 2.0 <oauth.4.2.2>` :term:`[RFC6749]` 
and OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices :term:`[OAuth.Responses]`.

In the :term:`Implicit Flow`, 
the entire response is returned in the :term:`fragment component` of the redirect URI, 
as defined in :ref:`4.2.2 of OAuth 2.0 <oauth.4.2.2>` :term:`[RFC6749]`.


.. glossary::

    access_token
        REQUIRED. Access Token for the UserInfo Endpoint. 

    token_type
        REQUIRED. 

        OAuth 2.0 Token Type value. 

        The value MUST be :term:`Bearer` 
        or another token_type value that the Client has negotiated with the Authorization Server. 

        Clients implementing this profile MUST support the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage :term:`[RFC6750]` specification. 
        This profile only describes the use of bearer tokens. 

    id_token
        REQUIRED. ID Token. 

    state
        OAuth 2.0 state value. 
        
        REQUIRED if the state parameter is present in the Client Authorization Request. 

        Clients MUST verify that the state value is equal to the exact value of state parameter in the Authorization Request. 

    expires_in
        OPTIONAL. Expiration time of the Access Token in seconds since the response was generated. 

The Client can then use the Access Token to access protected resources at Resource Servers.

The following is a non-normative example (with line wraps for the display purposes only):
