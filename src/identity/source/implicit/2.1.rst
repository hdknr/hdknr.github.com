2.1.  Implicit Flow
------------------------------

The Implicit Flow consists of the following steps:

    #. Client prepares an Authentication Request containing the desired request parameters.
    #. Client sends the request to the Authorization Server.
    #. Authorization Server authenticates the End-User.
    #. Authorization Server obtains End-User Consent/Authorization.
    #. Authorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client with an ID Token and, if requested, an Access Token.
    #. Client validates the tokens and retrieves the End-User's Subject Identifier.
