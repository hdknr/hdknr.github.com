4.2.  "jkt" (JWK SHA-256 Thumbprint) JWE Header Parameter
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This parameter has the same meaning, syntax, and processing rules as
the "jkt" JWS Header Parameter defined in :ref:`Section 4.1 <jwk_thumbprint>`, 
except that the JWK Thumbprint references 
the public key to which the JWE was encrypted; 
this can be used to determine the private key needed to decrypt the JWE.
