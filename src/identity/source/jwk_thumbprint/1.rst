1.  Introduction
========================

This specification defines 
a means of computing a thumbprint value (a.k.a. digest) 
of JSON Web Key (JWK) [JWK] objects analogous to the
"x5t" (X.509 Certificate SHA-1 Thumbprint) value defined for X.509
certificate objects.  

This specification also registers the new JSON
Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] and JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] Header
Parameters and the new JSON Web Key (JWK) [JWK] member name "jkt"
(JWK SHA-256 Thumbprint) for holding these values.
