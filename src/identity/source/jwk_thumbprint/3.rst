3.  JSON Web Key (JWK) Thumbprint
========================================

This specification defines 
the thumbprint of a JSON Web Key (JWK) 
as being a function of the REQUIRED members of the key's JWK
representation and a hash function.  

Specifically, 
for a hash function H, 
this function is the hash with H of the octets of the
UTF-8 representation of a JSON object [RFC7159] 
constructed containing only the REQUIRED members 
of a JWK representing the key 
and with no white space or line breaks 
before or after any syntactic elements 
and with the REQUIRED members ordered lexicographically by
the Unicode [UNICODE] code points of the member names.  

This JSON object is itself a legal JWK representation of the key.  
The details of this computation are further described in subsequent sections.
