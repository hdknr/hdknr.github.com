7.  Security Considerations
==============================

The JSON Security Considerations and Unicode Comparison Security
Considerations described in Sections 10.2 and 10.3 of JSON Web
Signature (JWS) [JWS] also apply to this specification.

Also, as described in Section 5, some implementations may produce
incorrect results if esoteric or escaped characters are used in the
member names.  The security implications of this appear to be limited
for JWK Thumbprints of public keys, since while it may result in
implementations failing to identify the intended key, it should not
leak information, since the information in a public key is already
public in nature, by definition.

A hash of a symmetric key has the potential to leak information about
the key value.  Thus, the JWK Thumbprint of a symmetric key should be
typically be concealed from parties not in possession of the
symmetric key, unless in the application context, the cryptographic
hash used, such as SHA-256, is known to provide sufficient protection
against disclosure of the key value.
