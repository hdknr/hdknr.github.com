3.4.  JWK Thumbprints of Keys Not in JWK Format
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that 
a key need not be in JWK format to create a JWK Thumbprint of it.  

The only prerequisites are that the JWK representation of the
key be defined and the party creating the JWK Thumbprint is in
possession of the necessary key material.  

These are sufficient to create the hash input 
from the JWK representation of the key, 
as described in :ref:`Section 3.3 <jwk_thumbprint>`.
