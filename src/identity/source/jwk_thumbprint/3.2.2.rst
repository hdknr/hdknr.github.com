3.2.2.  Why Not Include Optional Members?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OPTIONAL members of JWKs are intentionally not included 
in the JWK Thumbprint computation 
so that their absence or presence 
in the JWK doesn't alter the resulting value.  

The JWK Thumbprint value is **a digest of the key value itself** -- 
not of additional data that may also accompany the key.

OPTIONAL members are not included 
so that the JWK Thumbprint refers to a key -- 
not a key with an associated set of key attributes.  

This has the benefit that while in different application contexts
different subsets of attributes about the key might or 
might not be included in the JWK, 
the JWK Thumbprint of the key remains the same 
regardless of which optional attributes are present.  

Different kinds of thumbprints could be defined by other specifications 
that might include some or all additional JWK members, 
should use cases arise where such different kinds of thumbprints would be useful.  

See :ref:`Section 9.1 <jwk.9.1>` of [JWK] for notes on some ways 
to cryptographically bind attributes to a key.
