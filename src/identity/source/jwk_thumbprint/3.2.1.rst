3.2.1.  JWK Thumbprint of a Private Key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The JWK Thumbprint of a private key 
is computed as the JWK Thumbprint of the corresponding **public key**.  

This has the intentional benefit
that the same JWK Thumbprint value can be computed 
both by parties using either the public or private key.  

The JWK Thumbprint can then be used to refer to both keys of the key pair.  
Application context can be used to determine 
whether the public or the private key is the one being 
referred to by the JWK Thumbprint.

This specification defines the method of computing JWK Thumbprints of
private keys for interoperability reasons -- 
so that different implementations computing JWK Thumbprints 
of private keys will produce the same result.
