3.2.  JWK Members Used in the Thumbprint Computation
-------------------------------------------------------

Only the REQUIRED members of a key's representation are used 
when computing its JWK Thumbprint value.  

As defined in JSON Web Key (JWK) [JWK] and 
JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA], 
the REQUIRED members of an elliptic curve public key for the curves 
specified in :ref:`Section 6.2.1.1 <jwk.6.2.1.1>` of [JWK], 
in lexicographic order, are:

   -  "crv"
   -  "kty"
   -  "x"
   -  "y"

the REQUIRED members of an RSA public key, 
in lexicographic order, are:

   -  "e"
   -  "kty"
   -  "n"

and the REQUIRED members of a symmetric key, in lexicographic order,
are:

   -  "k"
   -  "kty"

As other key type values are defined, the specifications defining
them should be similarly consulted to determine which members, in
addition to ":term:`kty"`, are REQUIRED.
