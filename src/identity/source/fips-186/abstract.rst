Abstract 
============================

This Standard specifies a suite of algorithms 
that can be used to generate a :term:`digital signature`. 

Digital signatures are used 
to detect unauthorized modifications to data and 
to authenticate the identity of the signatory. 

In addition, 
the recipient of signed data can use a digital signature 
as evidence in demonstrating to a third party 
that the signature was, 
in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. 

This is known as :term:`non-repudiation`, 
since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time. 

Key words: 
 computer security,
 cryptography,
 digital signatures,
 Federal Information Processing Standards, 
 public key cryptography.
