Appendix D: Recommended Elliptic Curves for Federal Government Use 
========================================================================


This collection of :term:`elliptic curves` is recommended 
for Federal government use and contains choices for the private key length 
and underlying fields. 

These curves were generated using SHA-1 and the method given in the ANS X9.62 
and IEEE Standard 1363-2000 standards. 

This appendix describes the process that was used. 

Note that these curves are the same as those 
included in the previous version of this Standard.
