Abstract
====================

This specification defines the Form Post :term:`Response Mode`. 

In this mode, 
:term:`Authorization Response` parameters are encoded as :term:`HTML form` values 
that are auto-submitted in the User Agent, 
and thus are transmitted via the HTTP POST method to the Client, 
with the result parameters being encoded in the response body 
using the **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** format.
