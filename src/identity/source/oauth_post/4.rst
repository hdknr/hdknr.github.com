4.  Security Considerations
==========================================

As described in :doc:`OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices <oauth_responses>` 
[OAuth.Responses], 
there are security implications to encoding response values 
in the :term:`query string` and in the :term:`fragment` value. 

Some of these concerns can be addressed by using the Form Post Response Mode. 

In particular, 
it is safe to return Authorization Response parameters
whose default Response Modes are the query encoding 
or the fragment encoding 
using the :term:`form_post` :term:`Response Mode`.
