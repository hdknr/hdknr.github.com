2.  Form Post Response Mode
============================================================

This specification defines the Form Post Response Mode, 
which is described with its :term:`response_mode` parameter value:

.. glossary::

    form_post
        In this mode, 
        Authorization Response parameters are encoded as HTML form values 
        that are auto-submitted in the User Agent, 
        and thus are transmitted via the HTTP POST method to the Client, 
        with the result parameters being encoded in the response body 
        using the **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** format. 

        The action attribute of the form MUST be the Client's Redirection URI. 

        The method of the form attribute MUST be POST.

        Any technique supported by the User Agent MAY be used 
        to cause the submission of the form, 
        and any form content necessary to support this MAY be included, 
        such as submit controls and client-side scripting commands. 

        However, 
        the Client MUST be able to process the message 
        without regard for the mechanism 
        by which the form submission was initiated.
