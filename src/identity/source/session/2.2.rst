2.2.  Session Management Endpoints
---------------------------------------------

To manage a session, 
the :term:`Client` sends a request to the :term:`session management endpoints` at the :term:`Authorization Server`. 
The :term:`session management endpoints` at the :term:`Authorization Server` are:

.. glossary::

    Refresh Session
        Refreshes an expired ID Token 

    End Session
        Ends a session 

:term:`Authorization Servers` MUST support the use of the HTTP "GET" method as define in RFC 2616 [:term:`RFC2616`] 
and MAY support the "POST" method for all :term:`session management endpoints`.

(Draft 05)

.. note::
    - No client authentication ? ID Token is hard to guess and signed by Authz Server and client_id.
