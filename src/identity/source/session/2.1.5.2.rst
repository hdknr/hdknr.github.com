2.1.5.2.  Authorization Code Flow Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the response_type in the request includes code, 
the Authorization Response MUST return the parameters defined in :ref:`section 4.1.2 of OAuth 2.0 <oauth_4_1_1>` 
[:term:`OAuth2.0`] in the query of the response.

In addition, when response_type includes id_token, the ID Token is retrieved from the Token Endpoint.

Following is a non-normative example of a response:

::

    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: https://client.example.com/cb?code=i1WsRn1uB1
