2.1.1.  ID Token

This specification defines an :term:`ID Token` as a signed JWT [:term:`JWT`] 
that minimally contains the following Claims:

.. glossary::

    iss
        REQUIRED. 
        The :term:`Issuer Identifier` for the :term:`Issuer` of the response. 

    aud
        REQUIRED. 
        This member identifies the audience that this :term:`ID Token` is intended for. 
        It MUST be the OAuth 2.0 :term:`client_id` of the Client. 

    user_id
        REQUIRED. 
        A locally unique and never reassigned identifier 
        within the Issuer for the End-User that is intended to be consumed by the Client. 
        e.g. 24400320 or AItOawmwtWwcT0k51BayewNvutrJUqsvl6qs7A4. 
        It MUST NOT exceed **255** ASCII characters in length. 

    aud
        REQUIRED. 
        This member identifies the audience that this ID Token is intended for. 
        It MUST be the OAuth 2.0 client_id of the Client. 

    exp
        REQUIRED. 
        Type Integer. 
        Identifies the expiration time on or 
        after which the :term:`ID Token` MUST NOT be accepted for processing. 
        The processing of this parameter requires that the current date/time MUST be 
        before the expiration date/time listed in the value. 

        Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, 
        usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. 

        The value is number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z 
        as measured in UTC until the desired date/time. 

        See RFC 3339 [RFC3339] for details regarding date/times in general and UTC in particular. 

    acr
        OPTIONAL. 
        (:term:`Authentication Context Class Reference`): 
        Specifies an :term:`Authentication Context Class Reference` of the :term:`ID Token`. 
        The values "1", "2", "3", and "4" map to the ITU-T X.1254 | ISO/IEC 29115 [:term:`ISO29115`] 
        :term:`entity authentication assurance level` of the authentication performed. 

        The value "0" indicates the End User authentication did not meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 29115 level 1. 
        Authentication using a long-lived browser cookie, for instance, is one example 
        where the use of "level 0" is appropriate. 

        Authentications with level 0 should never be used to authorize access to any resource of any monetary value. 
        (This corresponds to the OpenID 2.0 PAPE nist_auth_level 0.) 
        An absolute URI or a registered short name [:term:`LoA.Registry`] MAY be used as an acr value. 

    nonce
        REQUIRED. 
        Clients MUST verify that the nonce value is equal to the value of the nonce parameter in the Authorization Request. 

The :term:`ID Token` MAY contain other Claims. 
The :term:`ID Token` can be used to access session information 
from an authenticated session or to pass a session to other applications.
