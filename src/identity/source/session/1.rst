1.  Introduction
========================

Sessions are used to keep track of information and interactions for users 
across multiple pages. 
This creates a sense of continuity, customization, 
and a more pleasant experience for the users. 
Visitors to an OpenID Relying Party site accessing :term:`Protected Resources` 
will be asked for authentication and authorization. 
Upon user authorization, 
the user will be granted access to the :term:`requested resources`. 

The site may perform other background tasks for the user using the same authenticated session. 
This allows the user to have a simplified experience without being asked for authorization 
each time and may even allow the user to go off-line while the tasks are being performed. 
This specification describes how OpenID Connect sessions can be created, used, and terminated.
