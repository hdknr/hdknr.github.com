2.3.  Session Synchronization
-----------------------------------

An :term:`ID Token` is usually bound to a user's :term:`sign in session` 
at the :term:`Authorization Server`, 
but in some cases, 
such as offline access by a web server or native application, it may not be. 
ID Tokens obtained in the following scenarios are bound to a user's signed-in state at the Authorization Server:

    -   Redeeming a :term:`code` for an Access Token and ID Token by way of indirect communication through the browser
    -   Obtaining an Access Token and ID Token in the authorization response through the browser
    -   Obtaining an ID Token at the Refresh Session Endpoint by submitting a previously issued ID Token

ID Tokens obtained in the above manner are session synchronized.

If an ID Token is obtained by submitting a Refresh Token at the Access Token Endpoint, 
then the resulting ID Token is not bound to a user's sign in state at the Authorization Server. 
The Client may be in offline mode or the user has logged out from the Authorization Server. 
If a session bound ID Token is desired, 
the Client should obtain a new ID Token by sending a request to the Refresh Session Endpoint.
