2.1.  Creating Sessions
------------------------------------

To create a session, 
the :term:`Client` sends an :term:`authorization request` 
to the :term:`Authorization Server` with :term:`id_token` as one of the :term:`response_type` values.

If the :term:`response_type` includes the value :term:`code`, 
then an :term:`ID token` is returned in the response of the :term:`Token Endpoint` 
when the :term:`Access Token` is retrieved.

If the :term:`response_type` includes the value :term:`token`, 
then an :term:`ID Token` is returned as a :term:`fragment parameter` 
in the :term:`redirect_uri` specified in the request.

In either case, 
an :term:`ID Token` will also be returned along with the :term:`Access Token` 
when submitting a :term:`Refresh Token` to the :term:`Token Endpoint` 
if the initial :term:`authorization request` included :term:`id_token` 
in the :term:`response_type` parameter.

The :term:`ID Token` serves as a **key** to an :term:`authenticated user session` 
and contains :term:`Claims` for the user.
