2.1.3.1.  Access Token Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    Tile should be "Token Endpoint Response" ?

After receiving and verifying a valid and authorized Access Token Request from the Client, 
the Authorization Server returns a successful response that includes an Access Token. 
The parameters in the successful response are defined in :ref:`Section 4.2.2 <oauth_4_2_2>` of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0].

In addition, 
this specification defines the following additional return parameters:


.. glossary::

    id_token
        REQUIRED if it was requested in the authorization request. 

Following is a non-normative example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "access_token": "SlAV32hkKG",
        "token_type": "JWT",
        "refresh_token": "8xLOxBtZp8",
        "expires_in": 3600,
        "id_token":"jwt_header.jwt_part2.jwt_part3"
    }

As in the OAuth 2.0 [OAuth2.0], 
Clients SHOULD ignore unrecognized response parameters.
