3.1.3.1.  Access Token Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After receiving and verifying a valid and authorized Access Token Request from the client, the Authorization Server returns a Positive Assertion that includes an Access Token. The parameters in the successful response are defined in Section 4.2.2 of OAuth 2.0 [OAuth.2.0] .

In addition, this specification defines the following additional return parameters:

    id_token
        REQUIRED if it was requested in the authorization request. It may be a JWS [JWS] of the ID token. 

Following is a non-normative example:

::

    {
        "access_token": "SlAV32hkKG",
        "token_type": "JWT",
        "refresh_token": "8xLOxBtZp8",
        "expires_in": 3600,
        "id_token":"jwt_header.jwt_part2.jwt_part3"
    }

As in the OAuth 2.0 [OAuth.2.0], Clients SHOULD ignore unrecognized response parameters.
