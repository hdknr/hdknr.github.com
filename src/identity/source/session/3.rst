3.  Creating and Updating Sessions
=============================================

In OpenID Connect, 
the session at the RP typically starts 
when the RP validates the End-User's ID Token. 

Refer to the :doc:`OpenID Connect Core 1.0 <core>` :term:`[OpenID.Core]` specification 
to find out how to obtain an :term:`ID Token` 
and validate it. 

When the OP supports session management, 
it MUST also return the **Session State** as an additional :term:`session_state` parameter 
in the Authorization Response. 

The OpenID Connect Authorization Response 
is specified in :ref:`Section 3.1.2.5 <core.3.1.2.5>` of OpenID Connect Core 1.0.

This parameter is:

.. glossary::

    session_state

        Session State. 

        JSON string that represents the End-User's login state at the OP. 

        This string is opaque to the RP. This is REQUIRED if session management is supported.
