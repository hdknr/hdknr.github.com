7.1.  Entropy of the code verifier
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The security model relies on the fact that the code verifier is not
   learned or guessed by the attacker.  It is vitally important to
   adhere to this principle.  As such, the code verifier has to be
   created in such a manner that it is cryptographically random and has
   high entropy that it is not practical for the attacker to guess.  It
   is RECOMMENDED that the output of a suitable random number generator
   be used to create a 32-octet sequence.
