4.1.  Client creates a code verifier
------------------------------------------------------------

The client first creates a code verifier, "code_verifier", 
for each OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] Authorization Request, 
in the following manner:

::

    code_verifier = high entropy cryptographic random ASCII [RFC0020]
    octet sequence using the url and filename safe Alphabet [A-Z] / [a-z]
    / [0-9] / "-" / "_" from Sec 5 of RFC 4648 [RFC4648], 
    with length less than 128 characters.

ABNF for "code_verifier" is as follows.

::

    code-verifier = 42*128unreserved
    unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_"
    ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A
    DIGIT = %x30-39

NOTE: code verifier SHOULD have enough entropy to make it impractical
to guess the value.  It is RECOMMENDED that the output of a suitable
random number generator be used to create a 32-octet sequence.  The
Octet sequence is then BASE64URL encoded to produce a 42-octet URL
safe string to use as the code verifier.
