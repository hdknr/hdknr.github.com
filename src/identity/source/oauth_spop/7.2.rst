7.2.  Protection against eavesdroppers
------------------------------------------------------------

   Clients MUST NOT try down grading the algorithm after trying "S256"
   method.  If the server is PKCE compliant, then "S256" method works.
   If the server does not support PKCE, it does not generate error.
   Only the time that the server returns that it does not support "S256"
   is there is a MITM trying the algorithm downgrade attack.

   "S256" method protects against eavesdroppers observing or
   intercepting the "code_challenge".  If the "plain" method is used,
   there is a chance that it will be observed by the attacker on the
   device.  The use of "S256" protects against it.

   If "code_challenge" is to be returned inside authorization "code" to
   achieve a stateless server, it has to be encrypted in such a manner
   that only the server can decrypt and extract it.
