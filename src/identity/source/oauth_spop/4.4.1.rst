4.4.1.  Error Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the server requires PKCE, 
and the client does not send the "code_challenge" in the request, 
the authorization endpoint MUST return the authorization error response 
with "error" value set to "invalid_request".  

The "error_description" or the response of "error_uri" 
SHOULD explain the nature of error, e.g., code challenge required.

If the server supporting PKCE does not support the requested transform, 
the authorization endpoint MUST return the authorization error response 
with "error" value set to "invalid_request".  

The "error_description" or the response of "error_uri" 
SHOULD explain the nature of error, e.g., transform algorithm not supported.

If the client is capable of using "S256", 
it MUST use "S256", as "S256" is MTI on the server.  
Clients MAY use plain only if they cannot support "S256" 
for some technical reason and knows that the server supports "plain".
