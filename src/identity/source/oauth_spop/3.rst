3.  Terminology
========================

In addition to the terms defined in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], this
specification defines the following terms:

.. glossary::

    code verifier  
        A cryptographically random string 
        that is used to correlate the authorization request 
        to the token request.

    code challenge  
        A challenge derived from the code verifier 
        that is sent in the authorization request, 
        to be verified against later.

    Base64url Encoding  
        Base64 encoding using the URL- and filename-safe character set 
        defined in Section 5 of :rfc:`4648` [RFC4648], 
        with all trailing '=' characters omitted 
        (as permitted by Section 3.2) 
        and without the inclusion of any line breaks, whitespace, 
        or other additional characters.  

        (See Appendix A for notes on implementing
        base64url encoding without padding.)
