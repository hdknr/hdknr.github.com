5.  Compatibility
=========================

Server implementations of this specification MAY accept OAuth2.0
Clients that do not implement this extension.  If the "code_verifier"
is not received from the client in the Authorization Request, servers
supporting backwards compatibility SHOULD revert to a normal OAuth
2.0 [RFC6749] protocol.

As the OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] server responses are unchanged by this
specification, client implementations of this specification do not
need to know if the server has implemented this specification or not,
and SHOULD send the additional parameters as defined in Section 3. to
all servers.
