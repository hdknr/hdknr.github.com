4.4.  Server returns the code
--------------------------------

When the server issues the "code" in the Authorization Response, 
it MUST associate the "code_challenge" and "code_challenge_method" values 
with the "code" so it can be verified later.

Typically, 
the "code_challenge" and "code_challenge_method" values are stored 
in encrypted form in the "code" itself, 
but could alternatively be stored on the server, 
associated with the code.  

The server MUST NOT include the "code_challenge" value 
in client requests in a form that other entities can extract.

The exact method that the server uses to associate the "code_challenge" 
with the issued "code" is out of scope for this specification.
