7.3.  Checking the Server support
---------------------------------------

   Before starting the authorization process, the client SHOULD check if
   the server supports this specification.  Confirmation of the server
   support may be obtained out-of-band or through some other mechanisms
   such as the discovery document in OpenID Connect Discovery
   [OpenID.Discovery].  The exact mechanism on how the client obtains
   this information, or the action it takes as a result is out of scope
   of this specification.
