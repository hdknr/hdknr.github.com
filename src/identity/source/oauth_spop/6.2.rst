6.2.  PKCE Code Challenge Method Registry
------------------------------------------------------

This specification establishes the PKCE Code Challenge Method
registry.

Additional code_challenge_method types for use with the authorization
endpoint are registered with a Specification Required ([RFC5226])
after a two-week review period on the oauth-ext-review@ietf.org
mailing list, on the advice of one or more Designated Experts.
However, to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication,
the Designated Expert(s) may approve registration once they are
satisfied that such a specification will be published.

Registration requests must be sent to the oauth-ext-review@ietf.org
mailing list for review and comment, with an appropriate subject
(e.g., "Request for PKCE code_challenge_method: example").

Within the review period, the Designated Expert(s) will either
approve or deny the registration request, communicating this decision
to the review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation
and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request
successful.

IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Expert(s)
and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
list.
