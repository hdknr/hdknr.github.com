Abstract
==========

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer 
on top of the :doc:`OAuth 2.0 <oauth>` protocol. 

It enables :term:`Clients` to verify the identity of the End-User 
based on the authentication performed by an :term:`Authorization Server`, 
as well as to obtain :term:`basic profile information <UserInfo>` 
about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.


This specification defines a mechanism for an OpenID Connect Relying Party 
to discover the End-User's OpenID Provider 
and obtain information needed to interact with it, 
including its OAuth 2.0 endpoint locations.
