Abstract
==========

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the :term:`OAuth 2.0` protocol. 
It allows :term:`Clients` to verify the identity of the :term:`End-User` 
based on the authentication performed by an :term:`Authorization Server`, 
as well as to obtain basic profile information about the :term:`End-User` in an interoperable and :term:`RESTful manner`.

This specification provides a mechanism for the OpenID Connect :term:`client` 
to discover the :term:`user <End-User>`'s :term:`OpenID Provider` 
as well as the necessary endpoints used by the OpenID Connect protocol suite.
