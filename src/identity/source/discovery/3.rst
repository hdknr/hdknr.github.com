3.  Provider Configuration Information
=========================================================

This step is optional. 
The OpenID Provider endpoints and configuration information may be obtained out-of-band.

Using the :term:`issuer` discovered in :ref:`Section 2 <discovery.2>` 
or through :term:`direct configuration`, the OpenID Provider's configuration can be retrieved.

OpenID Providers MUST make a JSON document available at the path 
formed by concatenating the string **/.well-known/openid-configuration** to the :term:`issuer`. 
The syntax and semantics of **.well-known** are defined in RFC 5785 [:term:`RFC5785`]. 
**openid-configuration** MUST point to a JSON document compliant with this specification.

OpenID Providers MUST support receiving SWD requests via :term:`TLS` 1.2 RFC 5246 [:term:`RFC5246`] 
and/or TLS 1.0 [:term:`RFC2246`] 
and MAY support other transport layer security mechanisms of equivalent security.
