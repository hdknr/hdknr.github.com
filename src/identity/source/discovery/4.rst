4.  String Operations
=========================

Processing some OpenID Connect messages requires comparing values in the messages to known values. 
For example, 
the member names in the provider configuration response might be compared to specific member names such as :term:`issuer`. 
Comparing Unicode strings, however, has significant security implications.

Therefore, comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings MUST be performed as specified below:

    - Remove any JSON applied escaping to produce an array of :term:`Unicode code points`.

    - Unicode Normalization [:term:`USA15`] MUST NOT be applied at any point to either the JSON string or to the string it is to be compared against.

    - Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed as a Unicode code point to code point equality comparison.

In several places, 
this specification uses space delimited lists of strings. 
In all such cases, 
only the ASCII space character (0x20) MAY be used for this purpose.
