4.3.  OpenID Provider Configuration Validation
--------------------------------------------------------

If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification fail, any operations requiring the information that failed to correctly validate MUST be aborted and the information that failed to validate MUST NOT be used.

If the configuration response contains the Issuer element, the value MUST exactly match the Issuer for the URL that was directly used to retrieve the configuration. Since the discovery process allows for multiple levels of redirection, this Issuer URL MAY be different from the one originally used to begin the discovery process.
