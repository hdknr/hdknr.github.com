2.1.3.  URL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A URL Identifier is normalized according to the following rules:

    -   If the URL does not have an RFC 3986 [:term:`RFC3986`] "scheme" portion, 
        the "https" scheme is prefixed to the URL, 
        with the "scheme" portion being separated from the "authority" portion by a "://" delimiter string. [#]_

    -   If the URL contains a :term:`fragment` portion, 
        it MUST be **stripped off** together with the fragment delimiter character "#". [#]_

    -   The resulting URL is used as the :term:`SWD principal`. 
        The :term:`SWD host` value is extracted from the "authority" portion 
        (as defined by RFC 3986 [:term:`RFC3986`]) of the URL 
        by concatenating the RFC 3986 **host** and **port** values of the URL. 
        See :ref:`Section 2.2.3 <discovery.2.2.3>` for a non-normative example.
