4.1.  OpenID Provider Configuration Request
------------------------------------------------------------

An OpenID Provider Configuration Document MUST be queried 
using an HTTPS GET request at the previously specified path.

The RP would make the following request 
to the Issuer https://example.com 
to obtain its Configuration information, 
since the Issuer contains no path component:

::

  GET /.well-known/openid-configuration HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com

If the Issuer value contains a **path** component, 
any terminating / MUST be removed 
before appending /.well-known/openid-configuration. 


The RP would make the following request 
to the Issuer https://example.com/issuer1 to 
obtain its Configuration information, 
since the Issuer contains a path component:

::

  GET /issuer1/.well-known/openid-configuration HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com

Using path components enables supporting multiple issuers per host. 
This is required in some **multi-tenant hosting configurations**. 

This use of .well-known is for supporting multiple issuers per host; 
unlike its use in RFC 5785 [RFC5785], 
it does not provide general information about the host.
