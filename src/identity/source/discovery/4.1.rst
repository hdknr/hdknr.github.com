4.1.  OpenID Provider Configuration Request
------------------------------------------------------------

An OpenID Provider Configuration Document MUST be queried using an HTTPS GET request at the previously specified path.

The Client would make the following request to the Issuer to get the Configuration information, if the Issuer contains no path component.

::

  GET /.well-known/openid-configuration HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com

If the Issuer value contains a **path** component, 
any terminating / MUST be removed before appending /.well-known/openid-configuration. 

The Client would make the following request to the Issuer to get the Configuration information, 
if the Issuer string were https://example.com/issuer1

::

  GET /issuer1/.well-known/openid-configuration HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com

Path components are allowed to support **multiple issuers per host**. 
This is required in some multi-tenant hosting configurations. 

This use of .well-known is for supporting multiple issuers per host, 
and unlike its use in RFC 5785 [RFC5785], 
it does not provide general information about the host.
