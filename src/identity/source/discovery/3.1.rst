-------------------------------------------------------

An :term:`OpenID Provider Configuration Document` MUST be queried 
using an HTTPS **GET** request 
at the previously specified path. 
The :term:`Client` MUST perform a TLS/SSL :term:`server certificate check`, 
per RFC 6125 [:term:`RFC6125`].

.. todo::

    Look at :rfc:`6125`
    ( Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service
    Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX)
    Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS) )

The Client would make the following request 
to the :term:`issuer` to get the Configuration information.

    GET /.well-known/openid-configuration HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
