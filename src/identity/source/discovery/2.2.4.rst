2.2.4.  User Input Using "acct" URI Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To find the Issuer for the given user input in the form of an account URI acct:juliet%40capulet.example@shoppingsite.example.com, the WebFinger parameters are as follows:

    =================== ============================================================
    WebFinger Parameter Value
    =================== ============================================================
    resource            acct:juliet%40capulet.example@shoppingsite.example.com
    host                shoppingsite.example.com
    rel                 http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer
    =================== ============================================================

Following the WebFinger specification, the Client would make the following request to get the discovery information (with line wraps within lines for display purposes only):

::

  GET /.well-known/webfinger
    ?resource=acct%3Ajuliet%2540capulet.example%40shoppingsite.example.com
    &rel=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer
    HTTP/1.1
  Host: shoppingsite.example.com

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/jrd+json

  {
   "subject": "acct:juliet%40capulet.example@shoppingsite.example.com",
   "links":
    [
     {
      "rel": "http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer",
      "href": "https://server.example.com"
     }
    ]
  }

Note: It is common for sites to use e-mail addresses as local identifiers for accounts at those sites, even though the domain in the e-mail address one controlled by the site. For instance, the site example.org might have a local account named joe@example.com. As of the time of this writing, a discussion is ongoing among WebFinger contributors about the syntax that should be used when discovering information about such accounts with WebFinger. The current thinking seems to be that such accounts would be represented by quoting the '@' character in the userinfo portion of the account identifier when constructing the acct: URI representing the account. Such an example is acct:joe%40example.com@example.org. In a future version of this specification, it is possible that normalization rules will be defined allowing End-Users to input values like joe@example.com@example.org to initiate discovery on such accounts.
