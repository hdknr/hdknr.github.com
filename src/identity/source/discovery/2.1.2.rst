2.1.2.  Normalization Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A string of any other type is interpreted as a URI in one of the forms 
scheme "://" authority path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ] or 
authority path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ] or 
scheme ":" path-rootless per :rfc:`3986` [RFC3986] 
and is normalized according to the following rules:

    1. If the user input Identifier does not have an :rfc:`3986` [RFC3986] scheme portion, 
       the string is interpreted as [userinfo "@"] host [":" port] path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ] per RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

    2. If the :term:`userinfo component` is present and all of the scheme component, 
       path component, query component, and port component are empty, the :term:`acct` scheme is assumed. 

       In this case, 
       the normalized URI is formed by prefixing acct: to the string as the scheme. 
       Per the 'acct' URI Scheme [I‑D.ietf‑appsawg‑acct‑uri], 
       if there is an at-sign character ('@') in the userinfo component, 
       it needs to be percent-encoded as described in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

    3. For all other inputs without a scheme portion, 
       the **https** scheme is assumed, 
       and the normalized URI is formed by prefixing https:// to the string as the scheme.

    4. When the input contains an explicit scheme such as :term:`acct` 
       that matches the RFC 3986 scheme ":" path-rootless syntax, 
       no input normalization is performed.

    5. If the resulting URI contains a fragment portion, 
       it MUST be stripped off together with the fragment delimiter character "#".

       The :term:`WebFinger` [I‑D.ietf‑appsawg‑webfinger] Resource in this case is 
       the resulting URI, 
       and the WebFinger Host is the authority component.

Note: Since the definition of authority in RFC 3986 [RFC3986] is [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ], 
it is legal to have a user input identifier like userinfo@host:port, e.g., alice@example.com:8080.
