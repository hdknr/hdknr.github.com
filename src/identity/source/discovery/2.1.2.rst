2.1.2.  E-Mail Address

Identifiers using e-mail address syntax MUST conform to the "addr-spec" syntax of RFC 5322 [:term:`RFC5322`] 
and MUST NOT contain any syntax designated by that specification as being obsolete. 

If the Identifier is an e-mail address, 
the :term:`SWD` :term:`principal` value is the **entire e-mail address** and 
the :term:`SWD` :term:`host` value is the "**domain**" portion of the "addr-spec".
