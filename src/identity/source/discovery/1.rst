1.  Introduction
========================

In order for an OpenID Client 
to utilize OpenID Connect services for a user, 
the Client needs to know where the OpenID Provider is. 
OpenID Connect uses :term:`Simple Web Discovery` [:term:`SWD`] 
to locate the OpenID Provider for an End-User.

Once an OpenID Provider is identified, 
the endpoint and other configuration information 
for that OP is retrieved from a well-known location as a JSON document.
