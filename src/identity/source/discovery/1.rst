1.  Introduction
========================

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 :term:`[RFC6749]` protocol. 
It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User 
based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, 
as well as to obtain basic profile information 
about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

In order for an OpenID Connect Relying Party to utilize OpenID Connect services 
for an End-User, 
the RP needs to know where the OpenID Provider is. 
OpenID Connect uses :doc:`WebFinger <webfinger>` :term:`[RFC7033]` 
to locate the OpenID Provider for an End-User. 
This process is described in :ref:`Section 2 <discovery.2>`.

Once the OpenID Provider has been identified, 
the configuration information for that OP is retrieved 
from a well-known location as a JSON document, 
including its OAuth 2.0 endpoint locations. 
This process is described in :ref:`Section 4 <discovery.4>`.
