2.1.1.  Identifier Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Identifiers starting with the XRI [:term:`XRI_Syntax_2.0`] global context symbols ('=','@', and '!') are RESERVED. 
Processing of these identifiers is out of scope for this specification.

Any Identifier that contains the '@' character in any position other than 
the first position MUST be treated as an e-mail address.

All other Identifiers MUST be treated as URLs. 
URLs containing the '@' character must escape any '@' characters so that they are represented as %40.

.. note::

    0. Check if the first character in ['=','@','!'] -> XRI
    1. Check "@" in Identifier -> Email
    2. Otherwise -> URL
