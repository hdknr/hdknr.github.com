2.1.1.  User Input Identifier Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A user input Identifier can be categorized into the following types, which require different normalization processes:

    1. User input Identifiers starting with the XRI [XRI_Syntax_2.0] global context symbols ('=','@', and '!') are RESERVED. 
       Processing of these identifiers is out of scope for this specification.

    2. All other user input Identifiers MUST be treated as a URI in one of the forms 
       scheme "://" authority path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ] 
       or authority path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ] 
       or scheme ":" path-rootless per RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

Note: The user input Identifier MAY be in the form of userinfo@host. 
For the End-User, 
this would normally be perceived as being an e-mail address. 
However, 
it is also a valid userpart "@" host section of an acct URI [I‑D.ietf‑appsawg‑acct‑uri], 
and this specification treats it such as to exclude various extra strings 
allowed in addr-spec of RFC 5322 [RFC5322].
