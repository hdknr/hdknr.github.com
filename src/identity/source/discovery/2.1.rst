2.1.  Identifier Normalization
---------------------------------------

The purpose of normalization is to determine a normalized Resource and Host from the user input Identifier. 
This is then used as input to WebFinger to discover the Issuer.

The user input Identifier SHOULD be a URL or URI relative reference defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]. 
The user input Identifier MUST include the authority component.

Note: A URI relative reference includes a string that looks like an e-mail address 
in the form of userinfo@host. 
This is a valid authority component of a URI 
but excludes various possible extra strings allowed in addr-spec syntax of RFC 5322 [RFC5322].

The Identifier normalization rules MAY be extended by additional specifications 
to enable other identifier types such as telephone numbers or XRIs [XRI_Syntax_2.0] to also be used.
