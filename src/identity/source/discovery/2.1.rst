2.1.  Identifier Normalization
----------------------------------------------------

The purpose of normalization is to extract a normalized :term:`principal`
and :term:`host` from the user input. 
This is then used as input to :term:`SWD` to discover the :term:`issuer`.

The :term:`user Identifier` SHOULD be one of the following:

    - E-Mail address

    - URL

The :term:`Identifier normalization` rules MAY be extended 
by additional specifications to enable other identifier types 
such as telephone numbers or XRIs [:term:`XRI_Syntax_2.0`] to also be used.

URLs without a ":term:`host`" portion are not supported by this specification.
