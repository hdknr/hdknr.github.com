3.3.  Provider Configuration Verification
----------------------------------------------------------------

If the configuration response contains the :term:`issuer` element, 
the value MUST exactly match the :term:`issuer` for the URL that was directly used to retrieve the configuration. 
Since the discovery process allows for multiple levels of redirection, 
this :term:`issuer` URL  be different from the one originally used to begin the discovery process.
