4.1.9. "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) Header Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The "x5c" (X.509 Certificate Chain) header parameter contains the
   X.509 public key certificate or certificate chain [RFC5280]
   corresponding to the key used to encrypt the JWE; this can be used to
   determine the private key needed to decrypt the JWE.  The certificate
   or certificate chain is represented as an array of certificate value
   strings.  Each string is a base64 encoded ([RFC4648] Section 4 -- not
   base64url encoded) DER [ITU.X690.1994] PKIX certificate value.  The
   certificate containing the public key of the entity that encrypted
   the JWE MUST be the first certificate.  This MAY be followed by
   additional certificates, with each subsequent certificate being the
   one used to certify the previous one.  The recipient MUST verify the
   certificate chain according to [RFC5280] and reject the JWE if any
   validation failure occurs.  Use of this header parameter is OPTIONAL.

   See Appendix B of [JWS] for an example "x5c" value.
