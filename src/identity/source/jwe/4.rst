4.  JWE Header
=====================

The members of the JSON object represented by the JWE Header describe 
the encryption applied to the :term:`Plaintext` 
and optionally additional properties of the JWE. 

The :term:`Header Parameter Names` within this object MUST be unique. 
Implementations MUST understand the entire contents of the header; 
otherwise, the JWE MUST be rejected for processing.
