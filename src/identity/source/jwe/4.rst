4.  JWE Header
=====================


   The members of the JSON object(s) representing the JWE Header
   describe the encryption applied to the Plaintext and optionally
   additional properties of the JWE.  The Header Parameter names within
   the JWE Header MUST be unique; recipients MUST either reject JWEs
   with duplicate Header Parameter names or use a JSON parser that
   returns only the lexically last duplicate member name, as specified
   in Section 15.12 (The JSON Object) of ECMAScript 5.1 [ECMAScript].

   Implementations are required to understand the specific Header
   Parameters defined by this specification that are designated as "MUST
   be understood" and process them in the manner defined in this
   specification.  All other Header Parameters defined by this
   specification that are not so designated MUST be ignored when not
   understood.  Unless listed as a critical Header Parameter, per
   Section 4.1.12, all Header Parameters not defined by this
   specification MUST be ignored when not understood.

   There are three classes of Header Parameter names: Registered Header
   Parameter names, Public Header Parameter names, and Private Header
   Parameter names.
