8.  Composition
==============================

This document does not specify a combination signed and encrypted mode. 

However, because the contents of a message can be arbitrary, 
encryption and data origin authentication can be provided 
by recursively encapsulating multiple JWE and JWS messages. 

In general, 
senders SHOULD sign the message and then encrypt the result 
(thus encrypting the signature). 
This prevents attacks in which the signature is stripped, 
leaving just an encrypted message, 
as well as providing privacy for the signer.
