1.  Introduction
============================================

JSON Web Encryption (JWE) is a compact encryption format intended for
space constrained environments such as HTTP Authorization headers and URI query parameters.  
It represents this content using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) :term:`[RFC4627]` based data structures.  
The JWE cryptographic mechanisms encrypt and provide integrity protection for
arbitrary sequences of bytes.

Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this specification are described 
in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (:doc:`JWA <jwa>`) :term:`[JWA]` specification.  
Related digital signature and MAC capabilities are described in the separate JSON Web Signature (:doc:`JWS <jws>`) :term:`[JWS]` specification.
