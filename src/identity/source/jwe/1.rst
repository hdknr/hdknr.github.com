1.  Introduction

JSON Web Encryption (JWE) is a compact encryption format 
intended for space constrained environments 
such as HTTP Authorization headers and 
URI query parameters. 

It provides a wrapper for encrypted content 
using JSON RFC 4627 [:term:`RFC4627`] data structures. 
The JWE encryption mechanisms are independent of the type of content being encrypted. 
A related signature capability is described in a separate JSON Web Signature (JWS) [:term:`JWS`] specification.
