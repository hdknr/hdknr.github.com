3.2.  JWE JSON Serialization Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------

In the JWE JSON Serialization, one or more of the JWE Protected
Header, JWE Shared Unprotected Header, and JWE Per-Recipient
Unprotected Header MUST be present.  In this case, the members of the
JOSE Header are the combination of the members of the JWE Protected
Header, JWE Shared Unprotected Header, and JWE Per-Recipient
Unprotected Header values that are present.

In the JWE JSON Serialization, a JWE object is represented as the
combination of these eight values,

   BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE Protected Header)),
   JWE Shared Unprotected Header,
   JWE Per-Recipient Unprotected Header,
   BASE64URL(JWE Encrypted Key),
   BASE64URL(JWE Initialization Vector),
   BASE64URL(JWE Ciphertext),
   BASE64URL(JWE Authentication Tag), and
   BASE64URL(JWE AAD),

with the six base64url encoded result strings and the two unprotected
JSON object values being represented as members within a JSON object.
The inclusion of some of these values is OPTIONAL.  The JWE JSON
Serialization can also encrypt the plaintext to multiple recipients.
See Section 7.2 for more information about the JWE JSON
Serialization.
