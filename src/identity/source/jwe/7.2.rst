7.2. Symmetric Encryption
------------------------------------

In the symmetric encryption mode, 
the :term:`CEK` is encrypted under a symmetric key shared 
between the sender and receiver.  

The symmetric encryption modes 
defined for use with this in this specification 
are listed in in :ref:`Table 3 <jwe.table3>`.  

For :term:`GCM`, the random 64-bit IV is prepended to the ciphertext.
