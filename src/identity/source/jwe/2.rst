   JSON Web Encryption (JWE)  
        A data structure representing an encrypted version of a Plaintext.  
        The structure consists of three parts: the JWE Header, the JWE Encrypted Key, and the JWE Ciphertext.

   Plaintext  
        The bytes to be encrypted - a.k.a., the message.

   Ciphertext  
        The encrypted version of the Plaintext.

   Content Encryption Key (CEK)  
        A symmetric key generated to encrypt
        the Plaintext for the recipient to produce the Ciphertext, which
        is encrypted to the recipient as the JWE Encrypted Key.
  
   CEK
        :term:`Content Encryption Key (CEK)`

   JWE Header  
        A string containing a JSON object that describes the
        encryption operations applied to create the JWE Encrypted Key and
        the JWE Ciphertext.

   JWE Encrypted Key  
        The :term:`Content Encryption Key (CEK)` is encrypted with the intended recipient's key 
        and the resulting encrypted content is recorded as a byte array, 
        which is referred to as the JWE Encrypted Key.

   JWE Ciphertext  
        A byte array containing the Ciphertext.

   Encoded JWE Header  
        Base64url encoding of the bytes of the UTF-8 RFC 3629 [RFC3629] representation of the JWE Header.

   Encoded JWE Encrypted Key  
        Base64url encoding of the JWE Encrypted Key.

   Encoded JWE Ciphertext  
        Base64url encoding of the JWE Ciphertext.

   Header Parameter Names  
        The names of the members within the JWE Header.

   Header Parameter Values  
        The values of the members within the JWE Header.

   Base64url Encoding  
        For the purposes of this specification, this term always refers to the URL- and filename-safe Base64 encoding
        described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648], Section 5, 
        with the (non URL-safe) '=' padding characters omitted, as permitted by Section 3.2.
        (See Appendix C of [JWS] for notes on implementing base64url encoding without padding.)
