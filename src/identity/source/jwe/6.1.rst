6.1. CMK Encryption
---------------------------------------------


JWE supports three forms of Content Master Key (CMK) encryption:

   -  Asymmetric encryption under the recipient's **public key**.

   -  Symmetric encryption under **a key shared** between the sender and receiver.

   -  Symmetric encryption under **a key agreed upon** between the sender and receiver.

See the algorithms registered for ":ref:`enc <jwe.enc>`" usage 
in the IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms registry [JWA] 
and :ref:`Section 4.1 of the JSON Web Algorithms <jwa.4.1>` (JWA) [JWA] specification 
for lists of encryption algorithms that can be used for CMK encryption.
