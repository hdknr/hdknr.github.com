7.  Serializations
=====================================================================

   JWE objects use one of two serializations, the JWE Compact
   Serialization or the JWE JSON Serialization.  Applications using this
   specification need to specify what serialization and serialization
   features are used for that application.  For instance, applications
   might specify that only the JWE JSON Serialization is used, that only
   JWE JSON Serialization support for a single recipient is used, or
   that support for multiple recipients is used.  JWE implementations
   only need to implement the features needed for the applications they
   are designed to support.
