3. JSON Web Encryption (JWE) Overview
======================================================

JWE represents encrypted content using JSON data structures and base64url encoding.  
The representation consists of three parts: the JWE Header, the JWE Encrypted Key, and the JWE Ciphertext.  
The three parts are base64url-encoded for transmission, 
and typically represented as the concatenation of the encoded strings in that order, 
with the three strings being separated by period ('.') characters, 
as is done when used in JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) :term:`[JWT]`.

JWE utilizes encryption to ensure the confidentiality of the contents of the Plaintext.  
JWE does not add a content integrity check if not provided by the underlying encryption algorithm.  
If such a check is needed, an algorithm providing it such as AES-GCM :term:`[NIST-800-38D]` can be used, 
or alternatively, it can be provided through composition by encrypting a representation of the signed content.
