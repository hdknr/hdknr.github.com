3. JSON Web Encryption (JWE) Overview
=============================================

JWE represents encrypted content using JSON data structures and
base64url encoding.  A JWE represents these logical values:

.. glossary::

    JOSE Header
       JSON object containing the parameters describing the cryptographic
       operations and parameters employed.  For a JWE object, the JOSE
       Header members are the union of the members of the JWE Protected
       Header, the JWE Shared Unprotected Header, and the JWE Per-
       Recipient Unprotected Header, as described below.
    
    JWE Encrypted Key
       Encrypted Content Encryption Key (CEK) value.
    
    JWE Initialization Vector
       Initialization Vector value used when encrypting the plaintext.
    
    JWE AAD
       Additional value to be integrity protected by the authenticated
       encryption operation.
    
    JWE Ciphertext
       Ciphertext value resulting from authenticated encryption of the
       plaintext with additional authenticated data.
    
    JWE Authentication Tag
       Authentication Tag value resulting from authenticated encryption
       of the plaintext with additional authenticated data.

For a JWE object, the JOSE Header represents the combination of these
logical values:
    
.. glossary::

    JWE Protected Header
       JSON object that contains the Header Parameters that are integrity
       protected by the authenticated encryption operation.  These
       parameters apply to all recipients of the JWE.
    
    JWE Shared Unprotected Header
       JSON object that contains the Header Parameters that apply to all
       recipients of the JWE that are not integrity protected.
    
    JWE Per-Recipient Unprotected Header
       JSON object that contains Header Parameters that apply to a single
       recipient of the JWE.  These Header Parameter values are not
       integrity protected.
    
JWE utilizes authenticated encryption to ensure the confidentiality
and integrity of the Plaintext and the integrity of the JWE Protected
Header and the JWE AAD.

This document defines two serializations for JWE objects: a compact,
URL-safe serialization called the JWE Compact Serialization and a
JSON serialization called the JWE JSON Serialization.  In both
serializations, the JWE Protected Header, JWE Encrypted Key, JWE
Initialization Vector, JWE Ciphertext, and JWE Authentication Tag are
base64url encoded for transmission, since JSON lacks a way to
directly represent octet sequences.  When present, the JWE AAD is
also base64url encoded for transmission.
