3. JSON Web Encryption (JWE) Overview
=============================================

JWE represents encrypted content using JSON data structures and base64url encoding.  
The representation consists of five parts: 
the :term:`JWE Header`, 
the :term:`JWE Encrypted Key`, 
the :term:`JWE Initialization Vector`, 
the :term:`JWE Ciphertext`, and 
the :term:`JWE Integrity Value`.  

.. note::

    **HEADER.KEY.IV.TEXT.INTEGRITY**

In the :term:`Compact Serialization`, 
the five parts are base64url-encoded for transmission,
and represented as the concatenation of the encoded strings 
in that order, 
with the five strings being separated by four period ('.') characters.  
(A :term:`JSON Serialization` for this information is defined in
the separate JSON Web Encryption JSON Serialization (JWE-JS) :term:`[JWE-JS]` specification.)

JWE utilizes encryption to ensure the confidentiality of the :term:`Plaintext`.  
JWE adds a content integrity check if not provided by the underlying encryption algorithm.
