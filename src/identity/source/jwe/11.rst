11.  Security Considerations
=================================

All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
must be faced by a JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  Among these issues are
protecting the user's asymmetric private and symmetric secret keys,
preventing various attacks, and helping avoid mistakes such as
inadvertently encrypting a message to the wrong recipient.  The
entire list of security considerations is beyond the scope of this
document.


All the security considerations in the JWS specification also apply
to this specification.  Likewise, all the security considerations in
XML Encryption 1.1 [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core1-20130411] also apply, other
than those that are XML specific.
