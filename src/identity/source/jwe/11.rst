11.  Security Considerations
=================================

All of the security issues faced by any cryptographic application
must be faced by a JWS/JWE/JWK agent.  Among these issues are
protecting the user's private and symmetric keys, preventing various
attacks, and helping the user avoid mistakes such as inadvertently
encrypting a message for the wrong recipient.  The entire list of
security considerations is beyond the scope of this document.

All the security considerations in the JWS specification also apply
to this specification.  Likewise, all the security considerations in
XML Encryption 1.1 [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core1-20130411] also apply, other
than those that are XML specific.
