11.1.  Using Matching Algorithm Strengths
---------------------------------------------------

Algorithms of matching strengths 
should be used together whenever possible.  

For instance, 
when AES Key Wrap is used with a given key size, 
using the same key size is recommended when AES GCM is also used.
