3.1.  JWE Compact Serialization Overview
---------------------------------------------------

In the JWE Compact Serialization, no JWE Shared Unprotected Header or
JWE Per-Recipient Unprotected Header are used.  In this case, the
JOSE Header and the JWE Protected Header are the same.

In the JWE Compact Serialization, a JWE object is represented as the
combination of these five string values,

   BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE Protected Header)),
   BASE64URL(JWE Encrypted Key),
   BASE64URL(JWE Initialization Vector),
   BASE64URL(JWE Ciphertext), and
   BASE64URL(JWE Authentication Tag),

concatenated in that order, with the five strings being separated by
four period ('.') characters.
