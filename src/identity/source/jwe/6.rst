6. Encrypting JWEs with Cryptographic Algorithms
=========================================================

JWE uses cryptographic algorithms 
to encrypt the Plaintext and the Content Encryption Key (CMK) 
and to provide integrity protection 
for the JWE Header, JWE Encrypted Key, and JWE Ciphertext.  

The JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [JWA] specification specifies 
a set of cryptographic algorithms and identifiers to be used 
with this specification and defines registries for additional such algorithms.  

Specifically, 
Section 4.1 specifies a set of ":ref:`alg <jwe.alg>`" 
(algorithm) header parameter values and 
Section 4.2 specifies a set of ":ref:`enc <jwe.enc>`" 
(encryption method) header parameter values 
intended for use this specification.  

It also describes the semantics and operations that are specific to these algorithms.

Public keys employed for encryption can be identified 
using the Header Parameter methods described in Section 4.1 or 
can be distributed using methods that are outside the scope of this specification.
