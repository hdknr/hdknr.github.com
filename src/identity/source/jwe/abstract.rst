Abstract
====================

JSON Web Encryption (JWE) is a means of representing encrypted content 
using JSON data structures. 
Related signature capabilities are described 
in the separate JSON Web Signature (:term:`JWS`) specification. 

(v.01)


 JSON Web Encryption (JWE) represents encrypted content 
using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) based data structures.

Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this
specification are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) :doc:`specification <jwa>` 
and IANA registries defined by that specification.

Related digital signature and MAC capabilities are described in the
separate JSON Web Signature (JWS) :doc:`specification <jws>`.
