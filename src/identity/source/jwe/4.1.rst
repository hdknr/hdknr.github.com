4.1. Reserved Header Parameter Names
------------------------------------------------

The following Header Parameter Names are reserved with meanings as
defined below.  All the names are short because a core goal of JWE is
for the representations to be compact.

Additional reserved Header Parameter Names MAY be defined via the
IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Header Parameters registry
[JWS].  As indicated by the common registry, JWSs and JWEs share a
common header parameter space; when a parameter is used by both
specifications, its usage must be compatible between the
specifications.
