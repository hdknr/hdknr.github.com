11.2.  Timing Attacks
-----------------------------------

To mitigate the attacks described in RFC 3218 [RFC3218], 
the recipient MUST NOT distinguish 
between format, padding, and length errors of encrypted keys.  

It is strongly recommended, 
in the event of receiving an improperly formatted key, 
that the receiver substitute a randomly generated CEK 
and proceed to the next step, 
to mitigate timing attacks.
