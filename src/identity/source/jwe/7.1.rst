7.1. JWE Compact Serialization
------------------------------------

The JWE Compact Serialization represents encrypted content as a
compact URL-safe string.  

This string is the concatenation of 

the Encoded JWE Header, 
the Encoded JWE Encrypted Key, 
the Encoded JWE Initialization Vector, 
the Encoded JWE Ciphertext, and 
the Encoded JWE Authentication Tag 

in that order, with the five strings being
separated by four period ('.') characters.  

Only one recipient is supported by the JWE Compact Serialization.

::

    [E-HEADER].[E-KEY].[E-IV].[Ciphertext].[E-TAG]
