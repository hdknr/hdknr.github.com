5.6.2.2.  Example of Distributed Claims
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this non-normative example, 
the OpenID Provider combines Normal Claims 
that it holds with references to Claims held by two different Claims Providers, B and C, 
incorporating references to some of the Claims held by B and C as Distributed Claims.

In this example, these Claims about Jane Doe are held 
by Claims Provider B (Jane Doe's bank):

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
   "shipping_address": {
     "street_address": "1234 Hollywood Blvd.",
     "locality": "Los Angeles",
     "region": "CA",
     "postal_code": "90210",
     "country": "US"},
   "payment_info": "Some_Card 1234 5678 9012 3456",
   "phone_number": "+1 (310) 123-4567"
  }

Also in this example, 
this Claim about Jane Doe is held by Claims Provider C (a credit agency):

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
   "credit_score": 650
  }

The OpenID Provider returns Jane Doe's Claims along with references 
to the Distributed Claims from Claims Provider B and Claims Provider C 
by sending the Access Tokens and URLs of locations 
from which the Distributed Claims can be retrieved:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
   "name": "Jane Doe",
   "given_name": "Jane",
   "family_name": "Doe",
   "email": "janedoe@example.com",
   "birthdate": "0000-03-22",
   "eye_color": "blue",
   "_claim_names": {
     "payment_info": "src1",
     "shipping_address": "src1",
     "credit_score": "src2"
    },
   "_claim_sources": {
     "src1": {"endpoint":
                "https://bank.example.com/claim_source"},
     "src2": {"endpoint":
                "https://creditagency.example.com/claims_here",
              "access_token": "ksj3n283dke"}
   }
  }
