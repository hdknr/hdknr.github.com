6.2.3.  Authorization Server Fetches Request Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon receipt of the Request, 
the Authorization Server MUST send an HTTP GET request 
to the :term:`request_uri` to retrieve the referenced Request Object, 
unless it is already cached, 
and parse it to recreate the Authorization Request parameters.

Note that the RP SHOULD use a unique URI 
for each request utilizing distinct parameters, 
or otherwise prevent the Authorization Server from caching the :term:`request_uri`.

The following is a non-normative example of this fetch process:

::

  GET /request.jwt HTTP/1.1
  Host: client.example.org
