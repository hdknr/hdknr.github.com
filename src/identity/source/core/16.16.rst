16.16.  Implicit Flow Threats
----------------------------------------

In the Implicit Flow, 
the Access Token is returned in the fragment component 
of the Client's :term:`redirect_uri` through HTTPS, 
thus it is protected between the OP and the User Agent, 
and between the User Agent and the RP. 

The only place it can be captured is the User Agent 
where the TLS session is terminated, 
which is possible if the User Agent is infected 
by malware or under the control of a malicious party.
