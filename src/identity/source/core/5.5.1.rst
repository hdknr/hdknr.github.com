5.5.1.  Individual Claims Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The userinfo and id_token members of the claims request 
both are JSON objects with the names of the individual Claims 
being requested as the member names. 

The member values MUST be one of the following:

.. glossary::

    null
        Indicates that this Claim is being requested 
        in the default manner. 

        In particular, this is a Voluntary Claim. 

        For instance, the Claim request:

        ::

            "given_name": null

        requests the given_name Claim in the default manner.

    JSON Object
        Used to provide additional information 
        about the Claim being requested. 

        This specification defines the following members:

            essential
                OPTIONAL. 

                Indicates whether the Claim being requested 
                is an Essential Claim. 

                If the value is true, 
                this indicates that the Claim is an Essential Claim. 

                For instance, the Claim request:

                ::

                    "auth_time": {"essential": true}

                can be used to specify that it is Essential 
                to return an auth_time Claim Value.

                If the value is false, 
                it indicates that it is a Voluntary Claim. 
                The default is false.

                By requesting Claims as Essential Claims, 
                the RP indicates to the End-User that 
                releasing these Claims will ensure a smooth authorization 
                for the specific task requested by the End-User. 

                Note that even if the Claims are not available 
                because the End-User did not authorize their release 
                or they are not present, 
                the Authorization Server MUST NOT generate an error 
                when Claims are not returned, 
                whether they are Essential or Voluntary, 
                unless otherwise specified in the description 
                of the specific claim.

            value
                OPTIONAL. 

                Requests that the Claim be returned 
                with a particular value. 

                For instance the Claim request:

                .. code-block:: javascript

                    "sub": {"value": "248289761001"}

                can be used to specify that the request apply to 
                the End-User with Subject Identifier 248289761001.

                The value of the value member MUST be a valid value 
                for the Claim being requested. 


                Definitions of individual Claims can include requirements 
                on how and whether the value qualifier is to be used 
                when requesting that Claim.

            values
                OPTIONAL. 

                Requests that the Claim be returned 
                with one of a set of values, 
                with the values appearing in order of preference. 

                For instance the Claim request:

                .. code-block:: javascript

                    "acr": {"essential": true,
                    "values": ["urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver",
                               "urn:mace:incommon:iap:bronze"]}

                specifies that it is Essential 
                that the :term:`acr` Claim be returned with     
                either the value urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver 
                or urn:mace:incommon:iap:bronze.

                The values in the :ref:`values` member array 
                MUST be valid values for the Claim being requested. 

                Definitions of individual Claims can include requirements 
                on how and whether the values qualifier is to be used 
                when requesting that Claim.

        Other members MAY be defined to provide additional information 
        about the requested Claims. 

        Any members used that are not understood MUST be ignored.

Note that when the :term:`claims` request parameter is supported, 
the :term:`scope` values that request Claims, as defined in :ref:`Section 5.4 <core.5.4>`, 
are effectively shorthand methods for requesting sets of individual Claims. 

For example, 
using the :term:`scope` value **openid email** and a :term:`response_type` 
that returns an Access Token is equivalent to 
using the :term:`scope` value **openid** and the following request for individual Claims.

Equivalent of using the **email** :term:`scope` value:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
   "userinfo":
    {
     "email": null,
     "email_verified": null
    }
  }
