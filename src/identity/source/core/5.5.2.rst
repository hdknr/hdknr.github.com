5.5.2.  Languages and Scripts for Individual Claims
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As described in :term:`Section 5.2 <core.5.2>`, 
human-readable Claim Values and Claim Values that 
reference human-readable values MAY be represented 
in multiple languages and scripts. 

Within a request for individual Claims, 
requested languages and scripts for particular Claims MAY be requested 
by including Claim Names that contain #-separated BCP47 [RFC5646] language tags 
in the Claims request, 
using the Claim Name syntax specified in Section 5.2. 

For example, 
a Family Name in Katakana in Japanese can be requested 
using the Claim Name family_name#ja-Kana-JP and a Kanji representation 
of the Family Name in Japanese can be requested using the Claim Name family_name#ja-Hani-JP. 

A German-language Web site can be requested with the Claim Name website#de.

If an OP receives a request for human-readable Claims in a language 
and script that it doesn't have, 
any versions of those Claims returned that don't use the requested language 
and script SHOULD use a language tag in the Claim Name.
