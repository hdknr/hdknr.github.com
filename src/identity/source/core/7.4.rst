7.4.  Self-Issued OpenID Provider Response
--------------------------------------------------------

OpenID Connect defines the following Claim for use in Self-Issued OpenID Provider Responses:

.. glossary::

    sub_jwk
        REQUIRED. 

        Public key used to check the signature of an ID Token 
        issued by a Self-Issued OpenID Provider, 
        as specified in Section 7. 

        The key is a bare key in JWK [JWK] format (not an X.509 certificate value). 

        The sub_jwk value is a JSON object. 

        Use of the sub_jwk Claim is NOT RECOMMENDED 
        when the OP is not Self-Issued.

Implicit Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Self-Issued OpenID Provider response 
is the same as the normal :ref:`Implicit Flow` response with the following refinements. 

Since it is an Implicit Flow response, 
the response parameters will be returned in the URL fragment component, 
unless a different Response Mode was specified.

Issuer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The iss (issuer) Claim Value is https://self-issued.me.

A sub_jwk Claim is present, 
with its value being the public key used to check the signature of the ID Token.

Subject
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`sub` (subject) Claim value is the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash 
of the concatenation of the octets of the UTF-8 representations of 
the base64url encoded key values in the :term:`sub_jwk` Claim. 

Key
^^^^^^^

When the kty value is RSA, 
the key values n and e are concatenated in that order. 

When the kty value is EC, the key values crv, x, and y are concatenated in that order.

Access Token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No Access Token is returned for accessing a UserInfo Endpoint, 
soadsafdsafall Claims returned MUST be in the ID Token.
