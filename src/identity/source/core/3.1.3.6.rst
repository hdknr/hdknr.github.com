3.1.3.6.  ID Token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The contents of the ID Token are as described in :ref:`Section 2 <core.2>`. 
When using the Authorization Code Flow, 
these additional requirements for the following ID Token Claims apply:

.. glossary::

    at_hash
        OPTIONAL. 

        Access Token hash value. 

        Its value is the :term:`base64url encoding` of 
        the left-most half of the hash of the octets of the ASCII representation of 
        the access_token value, 
        where the hash algorithm used is the hash algorithm used 
        in the :term:`alg` parameter of the ID Token's :doc:`JWS <jws>` [JWS] header. 

        For instance, 
        if the :term:`alg` is :term:`RS256`, 
        hash the :term:`access_token` value with :term:`SHA-256`, 
        then take the left-most 128 bits and :term:`base64url` encode them. 

        The :term:`at_hash` value is a case sensitive string.
