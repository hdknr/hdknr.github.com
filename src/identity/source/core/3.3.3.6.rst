3.3.3.6.  ID Token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the Hybrid Flow, 
the contents of an ID Token 
returned from the Token Endpoint are the same as for an ID Token 
returned from the Authorization Endpoint, 
as defined in :ref:`Section 3.3.2.11 <core.3.3.2.11>`, 
with the exception of the differences specified in this section.

If an ID Token is returned from both the Authorization Endpoint and from the Token Endpoint, 
which is the case for the :term:`response_type` values :term:`code id_token` 
and :term:`code id_token token`, 
the :term:`iss` and :term:`sub` Claim Values MUST be identical in both ID Tokens. 

All Claims about the Authentication event present in either SHOULD be present in both. 
If either ID Token contains Claims about the End-User, 
any that are present in both SHOULD have the same values in both. 

Note that the OP MAY choose to return fewer Claims about the End-User 
from the Authorization Endpoint, for instance, 
for privacy reasons. 

The :term:`at_hash` and :term:`c_hash` Claims MAY be omitted 
from the ID Token returned from the Token Endpoint 
even when these Claims are present in the ID Token returned from the Authorization Endpoint, 
because the ID Token and Access Token values returned from the Token Endpoint are 
already cryptographically bound together by the TLS encryption performed by the Token Endpoint.
