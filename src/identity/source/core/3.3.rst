3.3.  Authentication using the Hybrid Flow
------------------------------------------------------

This section describes how to perform authentication 
using the Hybrid Flow. 

When using the Hybrid Flow, 
some tokens are returned from the Authorization Endpoint 
and others are returned from the Token Endpoint. 

The mechanisms for returning tokens in the Hybrid Flow are 
specified in OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices 
[OAuth.Responses].
