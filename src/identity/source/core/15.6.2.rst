15.6.2.  Google "iss" Value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Implementers may want to be aware that, 
as of the time of this writing, 
Google's deployed OpenID Connect implementation issues ID Tokens 
that omit the required **https://** scheme prefix from the :term:`iss` (issuer) Claim Value. 

Relying Party implementations wishing to work with Google 
will therefore need to have code to work around this, 
until such time as their implementation is updated. 

Any such workaround code should be written in a manner 
that will not break at such point Google adds the missing prefix 
to their issuer values.
