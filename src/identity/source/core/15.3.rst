15.3.  Discovery and Registration
------------------------------------

Some OpenID Connect installations can use a pre-configured set 
of OpenID Providers and/or Relying Parties. 

In those cases, 
it might not be necessary to support dynamic discovery 
of information about identities 
or services or dynamic registration of Clients.

However, 
if installations choose to support unanticipated interactions 
between Relying Parties and OpenID Providers 
that do not have pre-configured relationships, 
they SHOULD accomplish this by implementing the facilities 
defined in the OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 :term:`[OpenID.Discovery]` 
and OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 
:term:`[OpenID.Registration]` specifications.
