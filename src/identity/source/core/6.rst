6.  Passing Request Parameters as JWTs
============================================

OpenID Connect defines the following Authorization Request parameters 
to enable Authentication Requests to be signed and optionally encrypted:

.. glossary::

    request
        OPTIONAL. 

        This parameter enables OpenID Connect requests to be passed in a single, 
        self-contained parameter and to be optionally signed and/or encrypted. 

        The parameter value is a Request Object value, 
        as specified in :ref:`Section 6.1 <core.6.1.>`. 

        It represents the request as a JWT whose Claims 
        are the request parameters.

    request_uri
        OPTIONAL. 

        This parameter enables OpenID Connect requests to be passed by reference, 
        rather than by value. 

        The request_uri value is a URL using the https scheme 
        referencing a resource containing a :term:`Request Object` value, 
        which is a JWT containing the request parameters.

Requests using these parameters are represented as JWTs, 
which are respectively passed by value or by reference. 

The ability to pass requests by reference is particularly useful 
for large requests. 

If one of these parameters is used, 
the other MUST NOT be used in the same request.
