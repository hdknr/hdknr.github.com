3.1.3.8.  Access Token Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the Authorization Code Flow, 
if the ID Token contains an :term:`at_hash` Claim, 
the Client MAY use it to validate the Access Token in the same manner 
as for the Implicit Flow, 
as defined in :ref:`Section 3.2.2.9 <core.3.2.2.9>`, 
but using the ID Token and Access Token returned from the Token Endpoint.
