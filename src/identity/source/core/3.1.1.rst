    2.  Client sends the request to the Authorization Server.
    3.  Authorization Server Authenticates the End-User.
    4.  Authorization Server obtains End-User Consent/Authorization.
    5.  Authorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client with an Authorization Code.
    6.  Client requests a response using the Authorization Code at the Token Endpoint.
    7.  Client receives a response that contains an ID Token and Access Token in the response body.
    8.  Client validates the ID token and retrieves the End-User's Subject Identifier.
