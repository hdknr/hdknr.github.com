3.1.2.4.  Authorization Server Obtains End-User Consent/Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the End-User is authenticated, 
the Authorization Server MUST obtain an authorization decision 
before releasing information to the Relying Party. 

When permitted by the request parameters used, 
this MAY be done through an interactive dialogue 
with the End-User that makes it clear what is being consented to 
or by establishing consent via conditions for processing the request 
or other means 
(for example, via previous administrative consent). 

:ref:`Sections 2 <core.2>` and :ref:`5.3 <core.2>` describe information release mechanisms.
