Abstract
===========

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. 
It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User 
based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, 
as well as to obtain basic profile information 
about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

This specification defines the core OpenID Connect functionality: 
authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 
and the use of Claims to communicate information about the End-User. 

It also describes the security and privacy considerations for using OpenID Connect.
