    Normal Claims
        Claims that are directly asserted by the OpenID Provider.

    Aggregated Claims
        Claims that are asserted by a Claims Provider 
        other than the OpenID Provider 
        but are returned by OpenID Provider.

    Distributed Claims
        Claims that are asserted by a Claims Provider 
        other than the OpenID Provider 
        but are returned as references by the OpenID Provider.
