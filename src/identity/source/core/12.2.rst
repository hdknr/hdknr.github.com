12.2.  Successful Refresh Response
------------------------------------

.. note::
    - ID Tokenは認証イベントに紐づいているのでリフレッシュしないこともある

Upon successful validation of the Refresh Token, 
the response body is the Token Response of 
:ref:`Section 3.1.3.3 <core.3.1.3.3>` 
except that it might not contain an :term:`id_token`.

If an ID Token is returned as a result of a token refresh request, 
the following requirements apply:

    -   its :term:`iss` Claim Value MUST be the same 
        as in the ID Token issued 
        when the original authentication occurred,

    -   its :term:`sub` Claim Value MUST be the same 
        as in the ID Token issued when the original authentication occurred,

    -   its :term:`iat` Claim MUST represent the time 
        that the new ID Token is issued,

    -   its :term:`aud` Claim Value MUST be the same 
        as in the ID Token issued 
        when the original authentication occurred,

    -   if the ID Token contains an :term:`auth_time` Claim, 
        its value MUST represent the time of the original authentication - 
        not the time that the new ID token is issued,

    -   its :term:`azp` Claim Value MUST be the same as 
        in the ID Token issued 
        when the original authentication occurred; 
        if no azp Claim was present in the original ID Token, 
        one MUST NOT be present in the new ID Token, and

    -   otherwise, 
        the same rules apply as apply when issuing an ID Token 
        at the time of the original authentication.

The following is a non-normative example of a Refresh Response:

::

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json
  Cache-Control: no-store
  Pragma: no-cache

  {
   "access_token": "TlBN45jURg",
   "token_type": "Bearer",
   "refresh_token": "9yNOxJtZa5",
   "expires_in": 3600
  }
