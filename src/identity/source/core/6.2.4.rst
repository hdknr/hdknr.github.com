6.2.4.  "request_uri" Rationale
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    - 根本原理、理論的根拠

There are several reasons that one might choose 
to use the :term:`request_uri` parameter:

    1.  The set of request parameters can become **large**, 
        and can exceed **browser URI size limitations**. 

        Passing the request parameters **by reference** can solve this problem.

    2.  Passing a :term:`request_uri` value, 
        rather than a complete request by value, 
        can reduce request latency.

    3.  Most requests for Claims from an RP are constant. 

        The :term:`request_uri` is a way of creating 
        and sometimes also signing and encrypting a constant set of request parameters 
        in advance. 

        (The request_uri value becomes an "artifact" 
        representing a particular fixed set of request parameters.)

    4.  Pre-registering a fixed set of request parameters at Registration time 
        enables OPs to cache and pre-validate the request parameters 
        at Registration time, 
        meaning they need not be retrieved at request time.

    5.  Pre-registering a fixed set of request parameters at Registration time 
        enables OPs to vet the contents of the request 
        from consumer protection and other points of views, 
        either itself or by utilizing a third party.
