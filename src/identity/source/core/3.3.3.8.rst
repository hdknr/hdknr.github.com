3.3.3.8.  Access Token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an Access Token is returned from both the Authorization Endpoint 
and from the Token Endpoint, 
which is the case for the :term:`response_type` values :term:`code token` and :term:`code id_token token`, 
their values MAY be the same or they MAY be different. 

Note that different Access Tokens might be returned be 
due to the different security characteristics of the two endpoints 
and the lifetimes and the access to resources granted by them might also be different.
