5.3.  UserInfo Endpoint
----------------------------

The UserInfo Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource 
that returns Claims about the authenticated End-User. 

To obtain the requested Claims about the End-User, 
the Client makes a request to the UserInfo Endpoint 
using an Access Token obtained through OpenID Connect Authentication. 

These Claims are normally represented 
by a JSON object that contains a collection of name 
and value pairs for the Claims.

Communication with the UserInfo Endpoint MUST utilize TLS. 
See Section 16.17 for more information on using TLS.

The UserInfo Endpoint MUST support the use of the HTTP GET 
and HTTP POST methods defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616].

The UserInfo Endpoint MUST accept Access Tokens 
as :doc:`OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage <oauth_bearer>` [RFC6750].

The UserInfo Endpoint SHOULD support 
the use of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (:ref:`CORS`) [CORS] 
and or other methods as appropriate to enable Java Script Clients 
to access the endpoint.
