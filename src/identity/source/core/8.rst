8.  Subject Identifier Types
=================================

A Subject Identifier is a locally unique and never reassigned identifier 
within the Issuer for the End-User, 
which is intended to be consumed by the Client. 

Two Subject Identifier types are defined by this specification:

    public
        This provides the same sub (subject) value to all Clients. 

        It is the default if the provider 
        has no subject_types_supported element in its discovery document.

    pairwise
        This provides a different sub value to each Client, 
        so as not to enable Clients 
        to correlate the End-User's activities without permission.

The OpenID Provider's :doc:`Discovery` document SHOULD list 
its supported Subject Identifier types 
in the :term:`subject_types_supported` element. 

If there is more than one type listed in the array, 
the Client MAY elect to provide its preferred identifier type 
using the :term:`subject_type` parameter during :doc:`Registration <reg>`.
