3.2.2.10.  ID Token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The contents of the ID Token are as described in :ref:`Section 2 <core.2>`. 
When using the Implicit Flow, 
these additional requirements for the following ID Token Claims apply:

.. glossary::

    nonce
        Use of the nonce Claim is REQUIRED for this flow.

    at_hash
        Access Token hash value. 
    
        Its value is the base64url encoding of the left-most half 
        of the hash of the octets of the ASCII representation 
        of the :term:`access_token` value, 
        where the hash algorithm used is the hash algorithm 
        used in the :term:`alg` header parameter 
        of the ID Token's :doc:`JWS <jws>` :term:`[JWS]` header. 

        For instance, 
        if the :term:`alg` is :term:`RS256`, 
        hash the :term:`access_token` value with :term:`SHA-256`, 
        then take the left-most 128 bits 
        and :term:`base64url` encode them. 

        The :term:`at_hash` value is a case sensitive string.

        If the ID Token is issued from the Authorization Endpoint 
        with an :term:`access_token` value, 
        which is the case for the :term:`response_type` value :term:`id_token token`, 
        this is REQUIRED; 
        it MAY NOT be used when no Access Token is issued, 
        which is the case for the :term:`response_type` value :term:`id_token`.
