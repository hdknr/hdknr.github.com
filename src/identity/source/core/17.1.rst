17.1.  Personally Identifiable Information
------------------------------------------------------

The UserInfo Response typically contains 
Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 

As such, End-User consent for the release of the information 
for the specified purpose should be obtained at 
or prior to the authorization time 
in accordance with relevant regulations. 

The purpose of use is typically registered 
in association with the :term:`redirect_uris`.

Only necessary UserInfo data should be stored 
at the Client and the Client SHOULD associate the received data 
with the purpose of use statement.
