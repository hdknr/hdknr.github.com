7.3.  Self-Issued OpenID Provider Request
------------------------------------------------------------

The Client sends the Authentication Request to the Authorization Endpoint 
with the following parameters:

.. glossary::

    scope
        REQUIRED. 

        scope parameter value, 
        as specified in Section 3.1.2.

    response_type
        REQUIRED. 

        Constant string value id_token.

    client_id
        REQUIRED. 
    
        Client ID value for the Client, 
        which in this case contains the redirect_uri value of the Client. 
        Since the Client's redirect_uri URI value is communicated as the Client ID, 
        a redirect_uri parameter is NOT REQUIRED to also be included in the request.

    id_token_hint
        OPTIONAL. 

        id_token_hint parameter value, 
        as specified in Section 3.1.2. 

        If the ID Token is encrypted to the Self-Issued OP, 
        the sub (subject) of the signed ID Token MUST be sent 
        as the kid (Key ID) of the JWE. 

        Encrypting content to Self-Issued OPs is currently only supported 
        when the OP's JWK key type is RSA 
        and the encryption algorithm used is RSA1_5.

    claims
        OPTIONAL. 

        claims parameter value, 
        as specified in Section 5.5.

    registration
        OPTIONAL. 

        This parameter is used by the Client to provide information 
        about itself to a Self-Issued OP that would normally be provided 
        to an OP during Dynamic Client Registration, 
        as specified in Section 7.2.1.

    request
        OPTIONAL. 

        Request Object value, as specified in Section 6.1. 
        The Request Object MAY be encrypted to the Self-Issued OP by the Client. 

        In this case, 
        the sub (subject) of a previously issued ID Token 
        for this Client MUST be sent as the kid (Key ID) of the JWE. 

        Encrypting content to Self-Issued OPs is currently only supported 
        when the OP's JWK key type is RSA and the encryption algorithm used is RSA1_5.

Other parameters MAY be sent. 
Note that all Claims are returned in the ID Token.

The entire URL MUST NOT exceed 2048 ASCII characters.

The following is a non-normative example HTTP 302 redirect response by the Client, 
which triggers the User Agent to make an Authentication Request 
to the Self-Issued OpenID Provider (with line wraps within values for display purposes only):

::

  HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: openid://?
    response_type=id_token
    &client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &scope=openid%20profile
    &state=af0ifjsldkj
    &nonce=n-0S6_WzA2Mj
    &registration=%7B%22logo_uri%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2F
