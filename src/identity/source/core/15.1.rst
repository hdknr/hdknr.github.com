15.1.  Mandatory to Implement Features for All OpenID Providers
------------------------------------------------------------------

All OpenID Providers MUST implement the following features defined in this specification. This list augments the set of features that are already listed elsewhere as being "REQUIRED" or are described with a "MUST", and so is not, by itself, a comprehensive set of implementation requirements for OPs.

    Signing ID Tokens with RSA SHA-256
        OPs MUST support signing ID Tokens 
        with the :term:`RSA` :term:`SHA-256` algorithm 
        (an alg value of RS256), 
        unless the OP only supports returning ID Tokens 
        from the Token Endpoint 
        (as is the case for the Authorization Code Flow) 
        and only allows Clients to register specifying none 
        as the requested ID Token signing algorithm.

    Prompt Parameter
        OPs MUST support the prompt parameter, 
        as defined in Section 3.1.2, 
        including the specified user interface behaviors such as none and login.

    Display Parameter
        OPs MUST support the display parameter, 
        as defined in Section 3.1.2. 
        (Note that the minimum level of support required for this parameter 
        is simply that its use must not result in an error.)

    Preferred Locales
        OPs MUST support requests for preferred languages 
        and scripts for the user interface 
        and for Claims via the **ui_locales** and **claims_locales** request parameters, 
        as defined in Section 3.1.2. 
        (Note that the minimum level of support 
        required for these parameters is simply 
        to have their use not result in errors.)

    Authentication Time
        OPs MUST support returning the time 
        at which the End-User authenticated 
        via the auth_time Claim, when requested, 
        as defined in Section 2.

    Maximum Authentication Age
        OPs MUST support enforcing a maximum authentication age 
        via the max_age parameter, 
        as defined in Section 3.1.2.

    Authentication Context Class Reference
        OPs MUST support requests for specific Authentication Context Class Reference values 
        via the :term:`acr_values` parameter, 
        as defined in Section 3.1.2. 

        (Note that the minimum level of support required for this parameter 
        is simply to have its use not result in an error.)
