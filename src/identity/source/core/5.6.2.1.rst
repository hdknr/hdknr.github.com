5.6.2.1.  Example of Aggregated Claims
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this non-normative example, 
Claims from Claims Provider A are combined with other Claims held by the OpenID provider, 
with the Claims from Claims Provider A being returned as Aggregated Claims.

In this example, 
these Claims about Jane Doe have been issued by Claims Provider A:


.. code-block:: javascript

  {
   "address": {
     "street_address": "1234 Hollywood Blvd.",
     "locality": "Los Angeles",
     "region": "CA",
     "postal_code": "90210",
     "country": "US"},
   "phone_number": "+1 (310) 123-4567"
  }

Claims Provider A signs the JSON Claims, 
representing them in a signed **JWT: jwt_header.jwt_part2.jwt_part3**. 
It is this :doc:`JWT` that is used by the OpenID Provider.

In this example, 
this JWT containing Jane Doe's Aggregated Claims from Claims Provider A 
is combined with other Normal Claims, 
and returned as the following set of Claims:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
   "name": "Jane Doe",
   "given_name": "Jane",
   "family_name": "Doe",
   "birthdate": "0000-03-22",
   "eye_color": "blue",
   "email": "janedoe@example.com",
   "_claim_names": {
     "address": "src1",
     "phone_number": "src1"
   },
   "_claim_sources": {
     "src1": {"JWT": "jwt_header.jwt_part2.jwt_part3"}
   }
  }
