5.3.4.  UserInfo Response Validation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Client MUST validate the UserInfo Response as follows:

    1. Verify that the OP that responded was the intended OP 
       through a TLS server certificate check, 
       per RFC 6125 [RFC6125].

    2. If the Client has provided 
       a :term:`userinfo_encrypted_response_alg` parameter during Registration, 
       decrypt the UserInfo Response 
       using the keys specified during Registration.

    3. If the response was signed, 
       the Client SHOULD validate the signature according to JWS [JWS].
