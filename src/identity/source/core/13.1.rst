13.1.  Query String Serialization
---------------------------------------

In order to serialize the parameters 
using the Query String Serialization, 
the Client constructs the string by adding the parameters and values 
to the query component of a URL 
using the **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** format 
as defined by :term:`[W3C.REC‑html401‑19991224]`. 

Query String Serialization is typically used in HTTP GET requests. 

The same serialization method is also used 
when adding parameters to the fragment component of a URL.

The following is a non-normative example of this serialization (with line wraps within values for display purposes only):

::

  GET /authorize?
    response_type=code
    &scope=openid
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
