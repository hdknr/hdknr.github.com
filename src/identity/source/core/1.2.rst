This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Authorization Code", "Authorization Endpoint", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server", "Client", "Client Authentication", "Client Identifier", "Client Secret", "Grant Type", "Protected Resource", "Redirection URI", "Refresh Token", "Resource Owner", "Resource Server", "Response Type", and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], the terms "Claim Name", "Claim Value", "JSON Web Token (JWT)", and "Nested JWT" defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT], the term "User Agent" defined by RFC 2616 [RFC2616], and the term "Response Mode" defined by OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices [OAuth.Responses].

This specification also defines the following terms:

.. glossary::

    Authentication
        Process used to achieve sufficient confidence 
        in the binding between the Entity and the presented Identity.

    Authentication Request
        OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request using extension parameters and scopes 
        defined by OpenID Connect to request 
        that the End-User be authenticated 
        by the Authorization Server, which is an OpenID Connect Provider, 
        to the Client, which is an OpenID Connect Relying Party.

    Authentication Context
        Information that the Relying Party can require 
        before it makes an entitlement decision 
        with respect to an authentication response. 

        Such context can include, but is not limited to, 
        the actual authentication method used or level of assurance 
        such as ISO/IEC 29115 :term:`[ISO29115]` entity authentication assurance level.

    Authentication Context Class
        Set of authentication methods or procedures 
        that are considered to be equivalent to each other in a particular context.

    Authentication Context Class Reference
        Identifier for an :term:`Authentication Context Class`.

    Authorization Code Flow
        OAuth 2.0 flow in which an :term:`Authorization Code` is returned 
        from the Authorization Endpoint 
        and all tokens are returned from the :term:`Token Endpoint`.

    Authorization Request
        OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request as defined by :term:`[RFC6749]`.

    Claim
        Piece of information asserted about an Entity.

    Claim Type
        Syntax used for representing a Claim Value. 

        This specification defines Normal, Aggregated, and Distributed Claim Types.

    Claims Provider
        Server that can return Claims about an Entity.

    Credential
        Data presented as evidence of the right to use an identity or other resources.

    End-User
        Human participant.

    Entity
        Something that has a separate and distinct existence 
        and that can be identified in a context. An End-User is one example of an Entity.

    Essential Claim
        Claim specified by the Client as being necessary 
        to ensure a smooth authorization experience 
        for the specific task requested by the End-User.

    Hybrid Flow
        OAuth 2.0 flow in which an Authorization Code is returned from the Authorization Endpoint, 
        some tokens are returned from the Authorization Endpoint, 
        and others are returned from the Token Endpoint.

    ID Token
        :doc:`JSON Web Token (JWT) <jwt>` :term:`[JWT]` 
        that contains Claims about the Authentication event. 

        It MAY contain other Claims.

    Identifier
        Value that uniquely characterizes an Entity in a specific context.

    Identity
        Set of attributes related to an Entity.

    Implicit Flow
        OAuth 2.0 flow in which all tokens are returned from the Authorization Endpoint 
        and neither the Token Endpoint nor an Authorization Code are used.

    Issuer
        Entity that issues a set of Claims.

    Issuer Identifier
        Verifiable Identifier for an Issuer. 

        An Issuer Identifier is a case sensitive URL 
        using the https scheme that contains scheme, host, and optionally, 
        port number and path components and **no query or fragment components**.

    Message
        Request or a response between an OpenID Relying Party 
        and an OpenID Provider.

    OpenID Provider (OP)
        OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server 
        that is capable of Authenticating the End-User 
        and providing Claims to a Relying Party 
        about the Authentication event and the End-User.

    Request Object
        JWT that contains a set of request parameters as its Claims.

    Request URI
        URL that references a resource containing a Request Object. 
        The Request URI contents MUST be retrievable by the Authorization Server.

    Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID)
        Identifier that identifies the Entity to a Relying Party 
        that cannot be correlated with the Entity's PPID at another Relying Party.

    Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
        Information that 
        (a) can be used to identify the natural person 
        to whom such information relates, 
        or (b) is or might be directly or indirectly linked to a natural person 
        to whom such information relates.

    Relying Party (RP)
        OAuth 2.0 Client application requiring End-User Authentication 
        and Claims from an OpenID Provider.

    Sector Identifier
        Host component of a URL used by the Relying Party's organization 
        that is an input to the computation of pairwise Subject Identifiers 
        for that Relying Party.

    Self-Issued OpenID Provider
        Personal, self-hosted OpenID Provider that issues self-signed ID Tokens.

    Subject Identifier
        Locally unique and never reassigned identifier within the Issuer for the End-User, 
        which is intended to be consumed by the Client.

    UserInfo Endpoint
        Protected Resource that, 
        when presented with an Access Token by the Client, 
        returns authorized information about the End-User represented 
        by the corresponding Authorization Grant. 

        The UserInfo Endpoint URL MUST use the https scheme and MAY contain port, path, and query parameter components.

    Validation
        Process intended to establish the soundness or correctness of a construct.

    Verification
        Process intended to test or prove the truth or accuracy of a fact or value.

    Voluntary Claim
        Claim specified by the Client as being useful 
        but not Essential for the specific task requested by the End-User.
