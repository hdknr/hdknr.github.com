6.2.1.  URL Referencing the Request Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Client stores the Request Object resource 
either locally or remotely 
at a URL the Server can access. 

This URL is the Request URI, :term:`request_uri`.

If the Request Object includes requested values for Claims, 
it MUST NOT be revealed to anybody 
but the Authorization Server. 

As such, 
the request_uri MUST have appropriate entropy for its lifetime. 
It is RECOMMENDED that it be removed 
if it is known that it will not be used again or after a reasonable timeout 
unless access control measures are taken.

The following is a non-normative example of a Request URI value 
(with line wraps within values for display purposes only):
