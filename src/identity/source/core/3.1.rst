3.1.  Authentication using the Authorization Code Flow
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes how to perform authentication 
using the :term:`Authorization Code Flow`. 
When using the Authorization Code Flow, 
all tokens are returned from the Token Endpoint.

The Authorization Code Flow returns an Authorization Code to the Client, 
which can then exchange it for an ID Token and an Access Token directly. 
This provides the benefit of not exposing any tokens to the User Agent 
and possibly other malicious applications with access to the User Agent. 

The Authorization Server can also authenticate the Client 
before exchanging the Authorization Code for an Access Token. 
The Authorization Code flow is suitable for Clients 
that can securely maintain a Client Secret 
between themselves and the Authorization Server.
