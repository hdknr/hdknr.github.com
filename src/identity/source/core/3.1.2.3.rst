3.1.2.3.  Authorization Server Authenticates End-User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the request is valid, 
the Authorization Server attempts to Authenticate the End-User 
or determines whether the End-User is Authenticated, 
depending upon the request parameter values used. 

The methods used by the Authorization Server to Authenticate the End-User 
(e.g. username and password, session cookies, etc.) 
are beyond the scope of this specification. 
An Authentication user interface MAY be displayed by the Authorization Server, 
depending upon the request parameter values used and the authentication methods used.

The Authorization Server MUST attempt 
to Authenticate the End-User in the following cases:

    - The End-User is not already Authenticated.
    - The Authentication Request contains the prompt parameter with the value login. In this case, the Authorization Server MUST reauthenticate the End-User even if the End-User is already authenticated.

The Authorization Server MUST NOT interact 
with the End-User in the following case:

    - The Authentication Request contains the :term:`prompt` parameter 
      with the value :term:`none`. 

      In this case, 
      the Authorization Server MUST return an error 
      if an End-User is not already Authenticated 
      or could not be silently Authenticated.

When interacting with the End-User, 
the Authorization Server MUST employ appropriate measures 
against Cross-Site Request Forgery and Clickjacking as, 
described in :ref:`Sections 10.12 <oauth.10.12>` 
and :ref:`10.13 <oauth.10.13>` of OAuth 2.0 :term:`[RFC6749]`.
