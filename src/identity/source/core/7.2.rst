7.2.  Self-Issued OpenID Provider Registration
--------------------------------------------------------

.. note::
    - RPのレジストレーション

When using a Self-Issued OP, registration is not required. 

The Client can proceed without registration 
as if it had registered with the OP 
and obtained the following Client Registration Response:


.. glssary::

    client_id
        redirect_uri value of the Client.

    client_secret_expires_at
        0

NOTE: 
        The OpenID Foundation plans to host the (stateless) endpoint 
        https://self-issued.me/registration/1.0/ that 
        returns the response above, 
        enabling RPs to not need any special processing 
        for registration with the Self-Issued OP. 

        This site will be hosted on an experimental basis. 
        Production implementations should not take a dependency upon it 
        without a subsequent commitment 
        by the OpenID Foundation to host the site 
        in a manner intended for production use.
