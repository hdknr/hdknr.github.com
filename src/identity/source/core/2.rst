2.  ID Token
========================

The primary extension that OpenID Connect makes to OAuth 2.
0 to enable End-Users to be Authenticated is the ID Token data structure. 

The ID Token is a **security token** that contains Claims 
about the Authentication of an End-User by an Authorization Server 
when using a Client, 
and potentially other requested Claims. 
The ID Token is represented as a :doc:`JSON Web Token (JWT) <jwt>` :term:`[JWT]`.

The following Claims are used within the ID Token for all OAuth 2.0 flows used by OpenID Connect:

.. glossary::

    iss
        REQUIRED. 

        Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response. 
        The :term:`iss` value is a **case sensitive URL** 
        using the **https** scheme that contains scheme, host, and optionally, 
        port number and path components and **no query or fragment components**.

    sub
        REQUIRED. 

        Subject Identifier. 
        A locally unique and never reassigned identifier 
        within the Issuer for the End-User, 
        which is intended to be consumed by the Client, 
        e.g., 24400320 or AItOawmwtWwcT0k51BayewNvutrJUqsvl6qs7A4. 


        It MUST NOT exceed 255 ASCII characters in length. 
        The sub value is a case sensitive string.

    aud
        REQUIRED. 

        Audience(s) that this ID Token is intended for. 
        It MUST contain the OAuth 2.0 :term:`client_id` of the Relying Party 
        as an audience value. 

        It MAY also contain identifiers for other audiences. 
        In the general case, 
        the :term:`aud` value is an **array** of case sensitive strings. 

        In the common special case when there is one audience, 
        the aud value MAY be a single case sensitive string.

    exp
        REQUIRED. 

        Expiration time on or after which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing. 

        The processing of this parameter requires 
        that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the value. 

        Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, 
        usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. 

        Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds 
        from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time. 

        See :rfc:`3339` :term:`[RFC3339]` for details 
        regarding date/times in general and UTC in particular.

    iat
        REQUIRED. 

        Time at which the JWT was issued. 

        Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds 
        from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.

    auth_time
        Time when the End-User authentication occurred. 

        Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds 
        from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time. 

        When a :term:`max_age` request is made 
        or when :term:`auth_time` is requested 
        as an :term:`Essential Claim`, then this Claim is REQUIRED; 
        otherwise, its inclusion is OPTIONAL. 

        (The auth_time Claim semantically corresponds to 
        the OpenID 2.0 PAPE :term:`[OpenID.PAPE]` **auth_time** response parameter.)

    nonce
        String value used to associate a Client session with an ID Token, 
        and to mitigate replay attacks. 

        The value is passed through unmodified 
        from the Authentication Request to the ID Token. 

        If present in the ID Token, 
        Clients MUST verify that the **nonce** Claim Value is 
        equal to the value of the **nonce** parameter 
        sent in the Authentication Request. 

        If present in the Authentication Request, 
        Authorization Servers MUST include a **nonce** Claim 
        in the ID Token with the Claim Value being the **nonce** value 
        sent in the Authentication Request. 

        .. caution::
            - authreq.nonceが指定されていたら、id_token.nonce にコピーする

        Authorization Servers SHOULD perform no other processing 
        on **nonce** values used. 

        The **nonce** value is a case sensitive string.

    acr
        OPTIONAL. 

        Authentication Context Class Reference. 

        String specifying an :term:`Authentication Context Class Reference` value 
        that identifies the Authentication Context Class 
        that the authentication performed satisfied. 

        The value "0" indicates the End-User authentication 
        did not meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 29115 :term:`[ISO29115]` level 1. 

        Authentication using a long-lived browser cookie, 
        for instance, is one example where the use of "**level 0**" is appropriate. 

        Authentications with level 0 SHOULD NOT be used to authorize access 
        to any resource of any monetary value. 
        
        (This corresponds to the OpenID 2.0 PAPE :ref:`[OpenID.PAPE]` **nist_auth_level 0**.) 

        An absolute URI or an RFC 6711 :term:`[RFC6711]` registered name 
        SHOULD be used as the acr value; 
        registered names MUST NOT be used with a different meaning than 
        that which is registered. 

        Parties using this claim will need to agree upon the meanings of the values used, 
        which may be context-specific. 

        The acr value is a case sensitive string.

    amr
        OPTIONAL. 

        Authentication Methods References. 

        JSON array of strings that are identifiers 
        for authentication methods used in the authentication. 

        For instance, 
        values might indicate that both password and OTP authentication methods were used. 

        The definition of particular values to be used 
        in the :term:`amr` Claim is beyond the scope of this specification. 

        Parties using this claim will need to agree upon the meanings of the values used, 
        which may be context-specific. 

        The amr value is an array of case sensitive strings.

    azp
        OPTIONAL. 

        Authorized party - the party to which the ID Token was issued. 

        If present, 
        it MUST contain the OAuth 2.0 Client ID of this party. 

        This Claim is only needed when the ID Token has a single audience value 
        and that audience is different than the authorized party. 
        
        It MAY be included even when the authorized party is the same as the sole audience. 

        The azp value is a case sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value.

ID Tokens MAY contain other Claims. 
Any Claims used that are not understood MUST be ignored. 

See Sections :ref:`3.1.3.6 <core.3.1.3.6>`, :ref:`3.3.2.11 <core.3.3.2.11>`, :ref:`5.1 <core.5.1>`, 
and :ref:`7.4 <core.7.4>` for additional Claims defined by this specification.

ID Tokens MUST be signed using JWS :term:`[JWS]` 
and optionally both signed and then encrypted 
using JWS :term:`[JWS]` and JWE :term:`[JWE]` respectively, 
thereby providing authentication, integrity, non-repudiation, and optionally, 
confidentiality, per :ref:`Section 16.14 <core.16.14.>`. 

If the ID Token is encrypted, 
it MUST be signed then encrypted, 
with the result being a Nested :doc:`JWT <jwt>`, as defined in :term:`[JWT]`. 
ID Tokens MUST NOT use **none** as the :term:`alg` value 
unless the Response Type used returns no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint 
(such as when using the Authorization Code Flow) 
and the Client explicitly requested the use of **none** at Registration time.

ID Tokens SHOULD NOT use the JWS or JWE x5u, x5c, jku, or jwk header parameter fields. 

    .. note::
        - キーヒントパラメータを使わないこと
        - 事前にネゴシエーションしたパラメータでキーを探す事

Instead, 
references to keys used are communicated in advance using :doc:`Discovery <discovery>` 
and :doc:`Registration <reg>` parameters, per :ref:`Section 10 <core.10>`.

The following is a non-normative example of 
the set of Claims (the JWT Claims Set) in an ID Token:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
   "iss": "https://server.example.com",
   "sub": "24400320",
   "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
   "nonce": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",
   "exp": 1311281970,
   "iat": 1311280970,
   "auth_time": 1311280969,
   "acr": "urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver"
  }
