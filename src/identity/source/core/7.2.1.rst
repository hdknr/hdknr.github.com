7.2.1.  Providing Information with the "registration" Request Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenID Connect defines 
the following Authorization Request parameter 
to enable Clients to provide additional registration information 
to Self-Issued OpenID Providers:

.. glossary::

    registration
        OPTIONAL. 

        This parameter is used by the Client to provide information about itself to a Self-Issued OP that would normally be provided to an OP during Dynamic Client Registration. The value is a JSON object containing Client metadata values, as defined in Section 2.1 of the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration] specification. The registration parameter SHOULD NOT be used when the OP is not a Self-Issued OP.

None of this information is REQUIRED by Self-Issued OPs, so the use of this parameter is OPTIONAL.

The registration parameter value is represented in an OAuth 2.0 request as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object (which ends up being form-urlencoded when passed as an OAuth parameter). When used in a Request Object value, per Section 6.1, the JSON object is used as the value of the registration member.

The Registration parameters that would typically be used 
in requests to Self-Issued OPs are :term:`policy_uri`, :term:`tos_uri`, and :term:`logo_uri`. 

If the Client uses more than one Redirection URI, 
the :term:`redirect_uris` parameter would be used to register them. 

Finally, 
if the Client is requesting encrypted responses, 
it would typically use the :term:`jwks_uri`, 
:term:`id_token_encrypted_response_alg` 
and :term:`id_token_encrypted_response_enc` parameters.
