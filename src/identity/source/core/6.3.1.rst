6.3.1.  Encrypted Request Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the Authorization Server has advertised JWE encryption algorithms 
in the :term:`request_object_encryption_alg_values_supported` and 
:term:`request_object_encryption_enc_values_supported` elements 
of its :doc:`Discovery` document [OpenID.Discovery], 
or has supplied encryption algorithms by other means, 
these are used by the Client to encrypt the JWT.

The Authorization Server MUST decrypt the JWT 
in accordance with the JSON Web Encryption [JWE] specification. 
The result MAY be either a signed or unsigned (plaintext) Request Object. 
In the former case, 
signature validation MUST be performed as defined in Section 6.3.2.

The Authorization Server MUST return an error if decryption fails.
