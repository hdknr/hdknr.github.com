15.  Implementation Considerations
=======================================

This specification defines features used by 
both Relying Parties and OpenID Providers. 

It is expected that some OpenID Providers will require 
static, out-of-band configuration of RPs using them, 
whereas others will support dynamic usage by RPs 
without a pre-established relationship between them. 

For that reason, 
the mandatory-to-implement features for OPs are listed below 
in two groups: 
the first :ref:`for all OPs <core.15.1>` 
and the second for :ref:`"Dynamic" OpenID Providers <core.15.2>`.
