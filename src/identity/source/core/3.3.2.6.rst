3.3.2.6.  Authentication Error Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the Hybrid Flow, 
Authorization Error Responses are made in the same manner 
as for the Authorization Code Flow, 
as defined in :ref:`Section 3.1.2.6 <core.3.1.2.6>`, 
with the exception of the differences specified in this section.

If the End-User denies the request or the End-User authentication fails, 
the Authorization Server MUST return the error Authorization Response 
in the fragment component of the Redirection URI, 
as defined in :ref:`4.2.2.1 of OAuth 2.0 <oauth.4.2.2.1>` :term:`[RFC6749]` 
and OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices [OAuth.Responses], 
unless a different Response Mode was specified.
