3.1.2.2.  Authentication Request Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Authorization Server MUST validate the request received as follows:

1.  The Authorization Server MUST validate all the OAuth 2.0 parameters 
    according to the :doc:`OAuth 2.0 specification <oauth>`.

2.  Verify that a :term:`scope` parameter is present 
    and contains the :term:`openid` scope value. 

    (If no openid scope value is present, 
    the request may still be a valid OAuth 2.0 request, 
    but is not an OpenID Connect request.)

3.  The Authorization Server MUST verify that all the REQUIRED parameters are present 
    and their usage conforms to this specification.

4.  If the :term:`sub` (subject) Claim is requested with a specific value 
    for the ID Token, 
    the Authorization Server MUST only send a :term:`positive response` 
    if the End-User identified by that :ref:`sub` value has an active session 
    with the Authorization Server 
    or has been Authenticated as a result of the request. 

    The Authorization Server MUST NOT reply with an ID Token or Access Token for a different user, 
    even if they have an active session with the Authorization Server. 

    Such a request can be made either using an :term:`id_token_hint` parameter 
    or by requesting a specific Claim Value as described 
    in :ref:`Section 5.5.1 <core.5.5.1>`, 
    if the :term:`claims` parameter is supported by the implementation.



As specified in OAuth 2.0 :term:`[RFC6749]`, 
Authorization Servers SHOULD ignore unrecognized request parameters.

If the Authorization Server encounters any error, 
it MUST return an error response, per :ref:`Section 3.1.2.6 <core.3.1.2.6>`.
