3.2.2.11.  ID Token Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the Implicit Flow, 
the contents of the ID Token MUST be validated in the same manner 
as for the Authorization Code Flow, 
as defined in :ref:`Section 3.1.3.7 <core.3.1.3.7>`, 
with the exception of the differences specified in this section.

    1.  The Client MUST validate the signature 
        of the ID Token according to :doc:`JWS` :term:`[JWS]` 
        using the algorithm specified in the :term:`alg` parameter of the :doc:`JWT` header.

    2.  The value of the :term:`nonce` Claim MUST be checked 
        to verify that it is the same value as the one 
        that was sent in the Authentication Request. 

        The Client SHOULD check the nonce value for :term:`replay attacks`. 

        The precise method for detecting :term:`replay attacks` is Client specific.
