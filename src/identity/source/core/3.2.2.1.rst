3.2.2.1.  Authentication Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authentication Requests are made as defined in :ref:`Section 3.1.2.1 <core.3.1.2.1>`, 
except that these Authentication Request parameters are used as follows:

.. glossary::

    response_type
        REQUIRED. 

        OAuth 2.0 Response Type value that determines 
        the authorization processing flow to be used, 
        including what parameters are returned from the endpoints used. 

        When using the Implicit Flow, 
        this value is :term:`id_token token` or :term:`id_token`. 

        The meanings of both of these values are defined 
        in OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices :term:`[OAuth.Responses]`. 

        No Access Token is returned when the value is id_token.

        NOTE: 

            While OAuth 2.0 also defines the :term:`token` Response Type value 
            for the Implicit Flow, 
            OpenID Connect does not use this Response Type, 
            since no ID Token would be returned.

    redirect_uri
        REQUIRED. 

        Redirection URI to which the response will be sent. 

        This URI MUST exactly match one of the Redirection URI values 
        for the Client pre-registered at the OpenID Provider, 
        with the matching performed as described in Section 6.2.1 of :term:`[RFC3986]` 
        (Simple String Comparison). 

        When using this flow, 
        the Redirection URI MUST NOT use the http scheme 
        unless the Client is a native application, 
        in which case it MAY use the http: scheme with localhost as the hostname.

    nonce
        REQUIRED. 

        String value used to associate a Client session with an ID Token, 
        and to mitigate replay attacks. 

        The value is passed through **unmodified** from the Authentication Request 
        to the ID Token. 

        Sufficient :term:`entropy` MUST be present in the :term:`nonce` values 
        used to prevent attackers from guessing values. 

        For implementation notes, see :ref:`Section 15.5.2 <core.15.5.2>`.

The following is a non-normative example request 
using the Implicit Flow 
that would be sent by the User Agent 
to the Authorization Server 
in response to a corresponding HTTP 302 redirect response 
by the Client 
(with line wraps within values for display purposes only):


::

  GET /authorize?
    response_type=id_token%20token
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &scope=openid%20profile
    &state=af0ifjsldkj
    &nonce=n-0S6_WzA2Mj HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
