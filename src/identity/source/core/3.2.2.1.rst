3.2.2.1.  Authentication Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authentication Requests are made as defined in Section 3.1.2.1, except that these Authentication Request parameters are used as follows:

.. glossary::

    response_type
        REQUIRED. 

        OAuth 2.0 :ref:`Response Type` value 
        that determines the authorization processing flow to be used, 
        including what parameters are returned from the endpoints used. 

        When using the :term:`Implicit Flow`, this value is **id_token token** or **id_token**. 

        The meanings of both of these values are defined 
        in :doc:`OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices <oauth_responses>` 
        :term:`[OAuth.Responses]`. 

        No Access Token is returned when the value is **id_token**.

        NOTE: 
        While OAuth 2.0 also defines the :term:`token` Response Type value for the Implicit Flow, 
        OpenID Connect does not use this Response Type, 
        since no ID Token would be returned.

    redirect_uri
        REQUIRED. 

        Redirection URI to which the response will be sent. 

        This URI MUST **exactly match** one of the Redirection URI values 
        for the Client pre-registered at the OpenID Provider, 
        with the matching performed as described in Section 6.2.1 of :term:`[RFC3986]` 
        (Simple String Comparison). 


        When using this flow, 
        the Redirection URI MUST NOT use the **http** scheme 
        unless the Client is a :term:`native application`, 
        in which case it MAY use the **http:** scheme with :term:`localhost` as the hostname.

        .. note::
            - 「完全一致！」
            - http://www.thread-safe.com/2014/05/covert-redirect-and-its-real-impact-on.html

    nonce
        REQUIRED. 

        String value used to associate a Client session with an ID Token, 
        and to mitigate replay attacks. 

        The value is passed through unmodified from the Authentication Request 
        to the ID Token. 
    
        **Sufficient entropy** MUST be present in the nonce values 
        used to prevent attackers from guessing values. 

        For implementation notes, see :term:`Section 15.5.2 <core.15.5.2>`.

The following is a non-normative example request 
using the Implicit Flow 
that would be sent by the User Agent to the Authorization Server 
in response to a corresponding HTTP 302 redirect response 
by the Client (with line wraps within values for display purposes only):

::

  GET /authorize?
    response_type=id_token%20token
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &scope=openid%20profile
    &state=af0ifjsldkj
    &nonce=n-0S6_WzA2Mj HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
