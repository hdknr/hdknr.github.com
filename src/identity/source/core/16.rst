16.  Security Considerations
==========================================

This specification references the security considerations defined in Section 10 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], and Section 5 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750]. Furthermore, the OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations [RFC6819] specification provides an extensive list of threats and controls that apply to this specification as well, given that it is based upon OAuth 2.0. ISO/IEC 29115 [ISO29115] also provides threats and controls that implementers need to take into account. Implementers are highly advised to read these references in detail and apply the countermeasures described therein.

In addition, the following list of attack vectors and remedies are also considered.
