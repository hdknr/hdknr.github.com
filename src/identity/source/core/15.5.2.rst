15.5.2.  Nonce Implementation Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`nonce` parameter value needs to include per-session state 
and be unguessable to attackers. 

One method to achieve this for Web Server Clients is 
to store a cryptographically random value 
as an :term:`HttpOnly` session cookie 
and use a cryptographic hash of the value as the :term:`nonce` parameter. 

In that case, 
the :term:`nonce` in the returned ID Token is compared 
to the hash of the session cookie to detect ID Token replay 
by third parties. 

A related method applicable to JavaScript Clients is 
to store the cryptographically random value 
in HTML5 local storage and 
use a cryptographic hash of this value.
