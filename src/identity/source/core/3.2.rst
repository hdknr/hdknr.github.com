3.2.  Authentication using the Implicit Flow
------------------------------------------------

.. note::
    - No Token Endpoint 
    - No Client Authentication

This section describes how to perform authentication using the Implicit Flow. 
When using the Implicit Flow, 
all tokens are returned from the Authorization Endpoint; 
the :term:`Token Endpoint` is not used.

The Implicit Flow is mainly used by Clients implemented 
in a browser using a scripting language. 

The Access Token and ID Token are returned directly to the Client, 
which may expose them to the End-User and applications 
that have access to the End-User's User Agent. 

The Authorization Server does not perform Client Authentication.
