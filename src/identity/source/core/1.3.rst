1.3.  Overview
----------------------------

The OpenID Connect protocol, 
in abstract, 
follows the following steps.

    1. The RP (Client) sends a request to the OpenID Provider (OP).
    2. The OP authenticates the End-User and obtains authorization.
    3. The OP responds with an ID Token and usually an Access Token.
    4. The RP can send a request with the Access Token to the UserInfo Endpoint.
    5. The UserInfo Endpoint returns Claims about the End-User.

These steps are illustrated in the following diagram:
