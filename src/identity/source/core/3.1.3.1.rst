3.1.3.1.  Token Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Client makes a Token Request by presenting its Authorization Grant 
(in the form of an Authorization Code) 
to the Token Endpoint 
using the :term:`grant_type` value :term:`authorization_code`, 
as described in :ref:`Section 4.1.3 of OAuth 2.0 <oauth.4.1.3>` :term:`[RFC6749]`. 

If the Client is a Confidential Client, 
then it MUST authenticate to the Token Endpoint 
using the authentication method registered for its :term:`client_id`, 
as described in :term:`Section 9 <core.9>`.

The Client sends the parameters to the Token Endpoint 
using the HTTP POST method and the Form Serialization, per Section 13.2, 
as described in :ref:`Section 4.1.3 of OAuth 2.0 <oauth.4.1.3>` :term:`[RFC6749]`.

The following is a non-normative example of a Token Request 
(with line wraps within values for display purposes only):

::

  POST /token HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW

  grant_type=authorization_code&code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
