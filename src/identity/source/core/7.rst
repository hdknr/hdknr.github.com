7.  Self-Issued OpenID Provider
====================================================

OpenID Connect supports Self-Issued OpenID Providers - 
personal, self-hosted OPs that issue self-signed ID Tokens. 
Self-Issued OPs use the special Issuer Identifier 
https://self-issued.me.

The messages used to communicate with Self-Issued OPs 
are mostly the same as those used to communicate with other OPs. 
Specifications for the few additional parameters used 
and for the values of some parameters 
in the Self-Issued case are defined in this section.
