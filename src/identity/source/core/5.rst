5.  Claims
===============

This section specifies how the Client can obtain Claims 
about the End-User and the Authentication event. 
It also defines a standard set of basic profile Claims. 

Pre-defined sets of Claims can be requested using specific :term:`scope` values 
or individual Claims can be requested using the :term:`claims` request parameter. 

The Claims can come directly from the OpenID Provider 
or from distributed sources as well.
