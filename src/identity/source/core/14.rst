14.  String Operations
========================

Processing some OpenID Connect messages requires 
comparing values in the messages 
to known values. 

For example, 
the Claim Names returned by the UserInfo Endpoint might be compared 
to specific Claim Names such as :term:`sub`. 

Comparing Unicode strings, 
however, has significant security implications.

Therefore, 
comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode strings MUST 
be performed as specified below:

    1.  Remove any JSON applied escaping 
        to produce an array of Unicode code points.

    1.  Unicode Normalization :term:`[USA15]` MUST NOT be applied 
        at any point to either the JSON string 
        or to the string it is to be compared against.

    1.  Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed 
        as a Unicode code point to code point equality comparison.

In several places, 
this specification uses space delimited lists of strings. 
In all such cases, 
a single ASCII space character (0x20) MUST be used as the delimiter.
