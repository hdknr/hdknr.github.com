3.1.2.2.  Authentication Request Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Authorization Server MUST validate the request received as follows:

    1.  The Authorization Server MUST validate 
        all the :doc:`OAuth 2.0 <oauth>` parameters 
        according to the OAuth 2.0 specification.

    2.  Verify that a :term:`scope` parameter is present 
        and contains the **openid** scope value. 

        (If no **openid** scope value is present, 
        the request may still be a valid OAuth 2.0 request, 
        but is not an OpenID Connect request.)

    3.  The Authorization Server MUST verify 
        that all the REQUIRED parameters are present 
        and their usage conforms to this specification.

    4.  If the :term:`sub` (subject) Claim is requested 
        with a specific value for the ID Token, 
        the Authorization Server MUST only send a positive response 
        if the End-User identified by that :term:`sub` value has an active session 
        with the Authorization Server 
        or has been Authenticated as a result of the request. 

        The Authorization Server MUST NOT reply with an ID Token 
        or Access Token for a different user, 
        even if they have an active session with the Authorization Server. 

        Such a request can be made either using an id_token_hint parameter 
        or by requesting a specific Claim Value 
        as described in :ref:`Section 5.5.1 <core.5.5.1>`, 
        if the claims parameter is supported by the implementation.

As specified in :doc:`OAuth 2.0 <oauth>` :ref:`[RFC6749]`, 
Authorization Servers SHOULD ignore unrecognized request parameters.

If the Authorization Server encounters any error, 
it MUST return an error response, 
per :ref:`Section 3.1.2.6 <core.3.1.2.6>`
