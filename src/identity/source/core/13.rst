13.  Serializations
==========================================

Messages are serialized using one of the following methods:

    - :ref:`Query String Serialization <core.13.1>`
    - :ref:`Form Serialization <core.13.2>`
    - :ref:`JSON Serialization <core.13.3>`

This section describes the syntax of these serialization methods; 
other sections describe 
when they can and must be used. 

Note that not all methods can be used 
for all messages.
