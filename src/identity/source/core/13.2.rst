13.2.  Form Serialization
----------------------------

Parameters and their values are Form Serialized 
by adding the parameter names and values 
to the entity body of the HTTP request 
using the **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** format 
as defined by :term:`[W3C.REC‑html401‑19991224]`. 

Form Serialization is typically used in HTTP POST requests.

The following is a non-normative example of this serialization 
(with line wraps within values for display purposes only):

::

  POST /authorize HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  response_type=code
    &scope=openid
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
