3.3.2.5.  Successful Authentication Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the Hybrid Flow, 
Authentication Responses are made in the same manner as for the Implicit Flow, 
as defined in Section 3.2.2.5, 
with the exception of the differences specified in this section.

These Authorization Endpoint results are used in the following manner:

.. glossary::

    access_token
        OAuth 2.0 Access Token. 

        This is returned when the :term:`response_type` value used is :term:`code token`, 
        or :term:`code id_token token`. 
        (A :term:`token_type` value is also returned in the same cases.)

    id_token
        ID Token. 

        This is returned when the :term:`response_type` value used 
        is :term:`code id_token` or :term:`code id_token token`.

    code
        Authorization Code. 

        This is always returned when using the Hybrid Flow.

The following is a non-normative example of a successful response using the Hybrid Flow (with line wraps for the display purposes only):

::

  HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: https://client.example.org/cb#
    code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
    &id_token=eyJ0 ... NiJ9.eyJ1c ... I6IjIifX0.DeWt4Qu ... ZXso
