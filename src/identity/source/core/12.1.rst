12.1.  Refresh Request
------------------------------

To refresh an Access Token, 
the Client MUST authenticate to the Token Endpoint 
using the authentication method registered 
for its :term:`client_id`, as documented in :ref:`Section 9 <core.9>`. 

The Client sends the parameters via **HTTP POST** 
to the Token Endpoint using 
Form Serialization, per :ref:`Section 13.2 <core.13.2>`.

The following is a non-normative example of a Refresh Request 
(with line wraps within values for display purposes only):

::

  POST /token HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &client_secret=some_secret12345
    &grant_type=refresh_token
    &refresh_token=8xLOxBtZp8
    &scope=openid%20profile

The Authorization Server MUST validate the Refresh Token, 
MUST verify that it was issued to the Client, 
and must verify that the Client successfully authenticated 
it has a Client Authentication method.
