6.3.2.  Signed Request Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To perform Signature Validation, 
the alg parameter in the JWS header MUST match the value of 
the :term:`request_object_signing_alg` set during Client Registration [OpenID.Registration] 
or a value that was pre-registered by other means. 

The signature MUST be validated against the appropriate key for that :term:`client_id` and algorithm.

The Authorization Server MUST return an error if signature validation fails.
