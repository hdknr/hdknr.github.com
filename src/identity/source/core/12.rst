12.  Using Refresh Tokens
====================================

A request to the :term:`Token Endpoint` can also use a :term:`Refresh Token` 
by using the :term:`grant_type` value :term:`refresh_token`, 
as described in :ref:`Section 6 of OAuth 2.0 <oauth.6>` :term:`[RFC6749]`. 

This section defines the behaviors for OpenID Connect Authorization Servers 
when Refresh Tokens are used.
