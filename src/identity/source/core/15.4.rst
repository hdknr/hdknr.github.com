15.4.  Mandatory to Implement Features for Relying Parties
----------------------------------------------------------------

In general, 
it is up to Relying Parties which features they use 
when interacting with OpenID Providers. 

However, 
some choices are dictated by the nature of their OAuth Client, 
such as whether it is a :term:`Confidential Client`, 
capable of keeping secrets, 
in which case the Authorization Code Flow may be appropriate, 
or whether it is a :term:`Public Client`, for instance, 
a User Agent Based Application or a statically registered Native Application, 
in which case the Implicit Flow may be appropriate.

When using OpenID Connect features, 
those listed as being "REQUIRED" 
or are described with a "MUST" are mandatory to implement, 
when used by a Relying Party. 

Likewise, those features that are described as "OPTIONAL" 
need not be used or supported 
unless they provide value in the particular application context. 

Finally, 
when interacting with OpenID Providers that support Discovery, 
the OP's Discovery document can be used to dynamically determine 
which OP features are available for use by the RP.
