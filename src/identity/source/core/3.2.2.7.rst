3.2.2.7.  Redirect URI Fragment Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since response parameters are returned in the Redirection URI :term:`fragment` value, 
the Client needs to have the User Agent parse the fragment encoded values 
and pass them to on to the Client's processing logic for consumption. 

See :ref:`Section 15.5.3 <core.15.5.3>` 
for implementation notes on URI fragment handling.
