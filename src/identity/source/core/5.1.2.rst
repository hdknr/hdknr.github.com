5.1.2.  Additional Claims
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While this specification defines only a small set of Claims 
as standard Claims, 
other Claims MAY be used in conjunction with the standard Claims. 

When using such Claims, 
it is RECOMMENDED that collision-resistant names be used for the Claim Names, 
as described in the JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT] specification. 

Alternatively, 
Private Claim Names can be safely used 
when naming conflicts are unlikely to arise, 
as described in the JWT specification. 

Or, 
if specific additional Claims will have broad and general applicability, 
they can be registered with Registered Claim Names, per the JWT specification.
