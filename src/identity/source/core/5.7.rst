5.7.  Claim Stability and Uniqueness
------------------------------------------

.. note::
    - ユニーク識別子 = iss + sub
    - 他はユニークで無い可能性があるのでキーとしては使わない事

The :term:`sub` (subject) and :term:`iss` (issuer) Claims, 
used together, are the only Claims that an RP can rely 
upon as a stable identifier for the End-User, 
since the sub Claim MUST be locally unique 
and never reassigned within the Issuer for a particular End-User, 
as described in :ref:`Section 2 <core.2>`. 

Therefore, 
the only guaranteed unique identifier 
for a given End-User is the combination of the :term:`iss` Claim and the :term:`sub` Claim.

All other Claims carry no such guarantees across different issuers 
in terms of stability over time or uniqueness across users, 
and Issuers are permitted to apply local restrictions and policies. 

For instance, 
an Issuer MAY re-use an :term:`email` Claim Value across different End-Users 
at different points in time, 
and the claimed :term:`email` address for a given End-User MAY change over time. 

Therefore, 
other Claims such as :term:`email`, :term:`phone_number`, and :term:`preferred_username` and 
MUST NOT be used as unique identifiers for the End-User.
