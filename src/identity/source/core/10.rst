10.  Signatures and Encryption
======================================================

Depending on the transport through which the messages are sent, 
the **integrity** of the message might not be guaranteed 
and the **originator** of the message might not be authenticated. 

To mitigate these risks, ID Token, UserInfo Response, Request Object, 
and Client Authentication JWT values can utilize JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS] 
to sign their contents. 

To achieve message **confidentiality**, 
these values can also use JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] to encrypt their contents.

When the message is both signed and encrypted, 
it MUST be signed first and then encrypted, 
per Section 16.14, 
with the result being a Nested JWT, as specified in [JWT]. 

Note that all JWE encryption methods perform **integrity checking**.

The OP advertises its supported signing and encryption algorithms 
in its :doc:`Discovery <dicovery>` document, 
or may supply this information by other means. 

The RP declares its required signing and encryption algorithms 
in its :doc:`Dynamic Registration <reg>` request, 
or may communicate this information by other means.

The OP advertises its public keys via its Discovery document, 
or may supply this information by other means. 

The RP declares its public keys via its Dynamic Registration request, 
or may communicate this information by other means.
