3.3.2.1.  Authentication Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authentication Requests are made as defined in :ref:`Section 3.1.2.1 <core.3.1.2.1>`, 
except that these Authentication Request parameters are used as follows:

.. glossary::

    response_type
        REQUIRED. 

        OAuth 2.0 Response Type value 
        that determines the authorization processing flow to be used, 
        including what parameters are returned from the endpoints used. 

        When using the Hybrid Flow, 
        this value is :term:`code id_token`, :term:`code token`, 
        or :term:`code id_token token`. 

        The meanings of these values are defined 
        in OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices [OAuth.Responses].

        .. note::
            - **code** + 何か、でHybrid

The following is a non-normative example request 
using the Hybrid Flow that would be sent by the User Agent to the Authorization Server 
in response to a corresponding HTTP 302 redirect response 
by the Client 
(with line wraps within values for display purposes only):

::

  GET /authorize?
    response_type=code%20id_token
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &scope=openid%20profile%20email
    &nonce=n-0S6_WzA2Mj
    &state=af0ifjsldkj HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
