6.3.  Validating JWT-Based Requests
--------------------------------------------------

When the request or request_uri Authorization Request parameters are used, 
additional steps must be performed to validate the Authentication Request 
beyond those specified in Sections 3.1.2.2, 3.2.2.2, or 3.3.2.2. 

These steps are to validate the JWT containing the Request Object 
and to validate the Request Object itself.
