3.3.1.  Hybrid Flow Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Hybrid Flow follows the following steps:

    1.  Client prepares an Authentication Request 
        containing the desired request parameters.

    2.  Client sends the request to the Authorization Server.

    3.  Authorization Server Authenticates the End-User.

    4.  Authorization Server obtains End-User Consent/Authorization.

    5.  Authorization Server sends the End-User 
        back to the Client with an Authorization Code and, 
        depending on the Response Type, one or more additional parameters.

    6.  Client requests a response  
        using the Authorization Code at the Token Endpoint.

    7.  Client receives a response that contains an ID Token 
        and Access Token in the response body.

    8.  Client validates the ID Token 
        and retrieves the End-User's Subject Identifier.
