3.1.2.5.  Successful Authentication Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Authentication Response is an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Response message 
returned from the OP's Authorization Endpoint 
in response to the Authorization Request message sent by the RP.

When using the :term:`Authorization Code Flow`, 
the Authorization Response MUST return the parameters 
defined in :ref:`Section 4.1.2 of OAuth 2.0 <oauth.4.1.2>` :term:`[RFC6749]` 
by adding them as query parameters to the :term:`redirect_uri` 
specified in the Authorization Request 
using the **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** format, 
unless a different Response Mode was specified.

The following is a non-normative example successful response 
using this flow (with line wraps within values for display purposes only):

::

  HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: https://client.example.org/cb?
    code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
    &state=af0ifjsldkj

For implementation notes on the contents of the Authorization Code, 
see Section :ref:`15.5.1 <core.15.5.1>`.
