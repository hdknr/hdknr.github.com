7.1.  Self-Issued OpenID Provider Discovery
--------------------------------------------------------

.. note::
    - RPはディスカバリしない
    - 固定の OP Meta Infoを使います

If the input identifier for the discovery process contains the domain self-issued.me, 
dynamic discovery is not performed. 

Instead, 
then the following static configuration values are used:


.. code-block:: javascript
  {
   "authorization_endpoint":
     "openid:",
   "issuer":
     "https://self-issued.me",
   "scopes_supported":
     ["openid", "profile", "email", "address", "phone"],
   "response_types_supported":
     ["id_token"],
   "subject_types_supported":
     ["pairwise"],
   "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported":
     ["RS256"],
   "request_object_signing_alg_values_supported":
     ["none", "RS256"]
  }

NOTE: 

    The OpenID Foundation plans 
    to host the OpenID Provider site https://self-issued.me/, 
    including its WebFinger service, 
    so that performing discovery on it returns 
    the above static discovery information, 
    enabling RPs to not need any special processing 
    for discovery of the Self-Issued OP. 

    This site will be hosted on an experimental basis. 

    Production implementations should not take a dependency 
    upon it without a subsequent commitment 
    by the OpenID Foundation to host the site 
    in a manner intended for production use.
