3.1.3.2.  Token Request Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Authorization Server MUST validate the :term:`Token Request` as follows:

-   Authenticate the Client 
    if it was issued Client Credentials or 
    if it uses another Client Authentication method, per Section 9.

-   Ensure the Authorization Code was issued 
    to the authenticated Client.

-   Verify that the Authorization Code is valid.

-   If possible, 
    verify that the Authorization Code 
    has not been previously used.

-   Ensure that 
    the :term:`redirect_uri` parameter value 
    is identical to the :term:`redirect_uri` parameter value 
    that was included in the initial :term:`Authorization Request`. 

    If the redirect_uri parameter value is not present 
    when there is only one registered redirect_uri value, 
    the Authorization Server MAY return an error 
    (since the Client should have included the parameter) 
    or MAY proceed without an error 
    (since OAuth 2.0 permits the parameter to be omitted in this case).

-   Verify that the Authorization Code used was issued 
    in response to an OpenID Connect Authentication Request 
    (so that an ID Token will be returned from the Token Endpoint).
