8.3.  Specification of Properties
------------------------------------

WebFinger defines both subject-specific properties (i.e., properties
described in Section 4.4.3 that relate to the URI for which
information is queried) and link-specific properties (see Section
4.4.4.5).  This section refers to subject-specific properties.

Applications that utilize subject-specific properties MUST define the
URIs used in identifying those properties, along with valid property
values.

Consider this portion of the JRD found in the example in Section 3.2.


.. code-block:: javascript

       "properties" :
       {
         "http://blgx.example.net/ns/version" : "1.3",
         "http://blgx.example.net/ns/ext" : null
       }

Here, two properties are returned in the WebFinger response.  Each of
these would be defined in a WebFinger application specification.
These two properties might be defined in the same WebFinger
application specification or separately in different specifications.
Since the latter is possible, it is important that WebFinger clients
not assume that one property has any specific relationship with
another property, unless some relationship is explicitly defined in
the particular WebFinger application specification.
