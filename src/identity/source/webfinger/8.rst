8.  Definition of WebFinger Applications
=============================================

This specification details the protocol syntax used to query a domain
for information about a URI, the syntax of the JSON Resource
Descriptor (JRD) that is returned in response to that query, security
requirements and considerations, hosted WebFinger services, various
expected HTTP status codes, and so forth.  However, this
specification does not enumerate the various possible properties or
link relation types that might be used in conjunction with WebFinger
for a particular application, nor does it define what properties or
link relation types one might expect to see in response to querying
for a particular URI or URI scheme.  Nonetheless, all of these
unspecified elements are important in order to implement an
interoperable application that utilizes the WebFinger protocol and
MUST be specified in the relevant document(s) defining the particular
application making use of the WebFinger protocol according to the
procedures described in this section.
