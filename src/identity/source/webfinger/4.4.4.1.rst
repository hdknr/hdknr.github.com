4.4.4.1.  rel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The value of the "rel" member is a string that is either a URI or a
registered relation type [8] (see RFC 5988 [4]).  The value of the
"rel" member MUST contain exactly one URI or registered relation
type.  The URI or registered relation type identifies the type of the
link relation.

The other members of the object have meaning only once the type of
link relation is understood.  In some instances, the link relation
will have associated semantics enabling the client to query for other
resources on the Internet.  In other instances, the link relation
will have associated semantics enabling the client to utilize the
other members of the link relation object without fetching additional
external resources.

URI link relation type values are compared using the "Simple String
Comparison" algorithm of Section 6.2.1 of RFC 3986.

The "rel" member MUST be present in the link relation object.
