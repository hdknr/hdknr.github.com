8.2.  Host Resolution
--------------------------------

As explained in Section 4, the host to which a WebFinger query is
issued is significant.  In general, WebFinger applications would
adhere to the procedures described in Section 4 in order to properly
direct a WebFinger query.

However, some URI schemes do not have host portions and there might
be some applications of WebFinger for which the host portion of a URI
cannot or should not be utilized.  In such instances, the application
specification MUST clearly define the host resolution procedures,
which might include provisioning a "default" host within the client
to which queries are directed.
