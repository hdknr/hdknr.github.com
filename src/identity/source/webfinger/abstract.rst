Abstract
================

This specification defines the WebFinger protocol, which can be used
to discover information about **people** or other **entities** on the
Internet using standard HTTP methods.  
WebFinger discovers
information for a URI that might not be usable as a locator
otherwise, such as account or email URIs.
