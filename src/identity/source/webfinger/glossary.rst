    Link Relation
    Link Relations
        A link relation is a descriptive attribute attached to a hyperlink 
        in order to define the type of the link, 
        or the relationship between the source and destination resources. 

        The attribute can be used by automated systems, or can be presented to a user in a different way. 

        Example uses include the standard way of referencing CSS 

        ::

            <link rel="stylesheet" href="example.css"/>

        , which indicates that the external resource linked to with the href attribute is a stylesheet, 
        so a web browser will generally fetch this file to render the page.
