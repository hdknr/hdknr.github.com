10.2.  JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD) Media Type
-------------------------------------------------------

This specification registers the media type application/jrd+json for
use with WebFinger in accordance with media type registration
procedures defined in RFC 6838 [10].

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: jrd+json

   Required parameters: N/A

   Optional parameters: N/A

     In particular, because RFC 4627 already defines the character
     encoding for JSON, no "charset" parameter is used.

Encoding considerations: See RFC 6839, Section 3.1.


   Security considerations:

     The JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD) is a JavaScript Object Notation
     (JSON) object.  It is a text format that must be parsed by entities
     that wish to utilize the format.  Depending on the language and
     mechanism used to parse a JSON object, it is possible for an
     attacker to inject behavior into a running program.  Therefore,
     care must be taken to properly parse a received JRD to ensure that
     only a valid JSON object is present and that no JavaScript or other
     code is injected or executed unexpectedly.

   Interoperability considerations:

     This media type is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object and
     can be consumed by any software application that can consume JSON
     objects.

   Published specification: RFC 7033

   Applications that use this media type:

     The JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD) is used by the WebFinger
     protocol (RFC 7033) to enable the exchange of information between a
     client and a WebFinger resource over HTTPS.

   Fragment identifier considerations:

     The syntax and semantics of fragment identifiers SHOULD be as
     specified for "application/json".  (At publication of this
     document, there is no fragment identification syntax defined for
     "application/json".)
