3.4. Retrieving Device Information
------------------------------------------

As another example, 
suppose there are printers on the network and 
you would like to check the current toner level 
for a particular printer identified via the URI device:p1.example.com.  

While the "device" URI scheme is not presently specified, 
we use it here for illustrative purposes.

Following the procedures similar to those above, 
a query may be issued to get link relations 
specific to this URI like this:

::

     GET /.well-known/webfinger?
                       resource=device%3Ap1.example.com HTTP/1.1
     Host: p1.example.com

The link relations that are returned for a device 
may be quite different than those for user accounts.  

Perhaps we may see a response like this:

::

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
     Content-Type: application/jrd+json

     {
       "subject" : "device:p1.example.com",
       "links" :
       [
         {
           "rel" : "http://webfinger.example/rel/tipsi",
           "href" : "http://192.168.1.5/npap/"
         }
       ]
     }

While this example is fictitious, 
you can imagine that perhaps the Transport Independent, 
Printer/System Interface :term:`[17]` may be enhanced with a web interface enabling a device 
that understands the TIP/SI web interface specification 
to query the printer for toner levels.
