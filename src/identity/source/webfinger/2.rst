2. Terminology
====================

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

WebFinger makes heavy use of ":term:`Link Relations`".  
Briefly, a :term:`Link Relation` is an **attribute** and **value** pair 
used on the Internet wherein
the **attribute** identifies the **type of link** to which the associated value refers.  
In Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) :term:`[2]` and Web Linking Error! Reference source not found., 
the attribute is a "**rel**" and the value is an "**href**".
