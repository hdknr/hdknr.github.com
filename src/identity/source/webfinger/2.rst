2.  Terminology
====================

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

WebFinger makes heavy use of "link relations".  A link relation is an
attribute-value pair in which the attribute identifies the type of
relationship between the linked entity or resource and the
information specified in the value.  In Web Linking [4], the link
relation is represented using an HTTP entity-header of "Link", where
the "rel" attribute specifies the type of relationship and the "href"
attribute specifies the information that is linked to the entity or
resource.  In WebFinger, the same concept is represented using a JSON
array of "links" objects, where each member named "rel" specifies the
type of relationship and each member named "href" specifies the
information that is linked to the entity or resource.  Note that
WebFinger narrows the scope of a link relation beyond what is defined
for Web Linking by stipulating that the value of the "rel" member
needs to be either a single IANA-registered link relation type [8] or
a URI [6].

The use of URIs throughout this document refers to URIs following the
syntax specified in Section 3 of RFC 3986 [6].  Relative URIs, having
syntax following that of Section 4.2 of RFC 3986, are not used with
WebFinger.
