4.2. Performing a WebFinger Query
---------------------------------------


   A WebFinger client issues a query to the well-known [3] resource
   identified by the URI whose path component begins with "/.well-
   known/webfinger" and whose query component MUST include the
   "resource" parameter exactly once and set to the value of the URI for
   which information is being sought.  If the "resource" parameter is
   absent or malformed, the WebFinger resource MUST indicate that the
   request is bad as per Section 10.4.1 of RFC 2616 [2].

   A client MUST query the WebFinger resource using HTTPS only.  If the
   client determines that the resource has an invalid certificate, the
   resource returns a 4xx or 5xx status code, or the HTTPS connection
   cannot be established for any reason, then the client MUST accept
   that the WebFinger query has failed and MUST NOT attempt to reissue
   the WebFinger request using HTTP over a non-secure connection.

   A WebFinger resource MUST return a JRD as the representation for the
   resource if the client requests no other supported format explicitly
   via the HTTP "Accept" header.  The client MAY include the "Accept"
   header to indicate a desired representation; representations other
   than JRD might be defined in future specifications.  The WebFinger
   resource MUST silently ignore any requested representations that it
   does not understand and support.  The media type used for the JSON
   Resource Descriptor (JRD) is "application/jrd+json" (see Section
   9.2).

   A WebFinger resource MAY redirect the client; if it does, the
   redirection MUST only be to an "https" URI.

   A WebFinger resource can include cache validators in a response to
   enable conditional requests by the client and/or expiration times as
   per Section 13 of RFC 2616.
