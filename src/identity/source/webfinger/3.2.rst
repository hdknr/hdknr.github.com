3.2.  Getting Author and Copyright Information for a Web Page
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose an application is defined to retrieve metadata information
about a web page URL, such as author and copyright information.  To
retrieve that information, the client can utilize WebFinger to issue
a query for the specific URL.  Suppose the URL of interest is
http://blog.example.com/article/id/314.  The client would issue a
query similar to the following:

::

     GET /.well-known/webfinger?
          resource=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.example.com%2Farticle%2Fid%2F314
          HTTP/1.1
     Host: blog.example.com


The server might then reply in this way:

::

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
     Content-Type: application/jrd+json

     {
       "subject" : "http://blog.example.com/article/id/314",
       "aliases" :
       [
         "http://blog.example.com/cool_new_thing",
         "http://blog.example.com/steve/article/7"
       ],
       "properties" :
       {
         "http://blgx.example.net/ns/version" : "1.3",
         "http://blgx.example.net/ns/ext" : null
       },
       "links" :
       [
         {
           "rel" : "copyright",
           "href" : "http://www.example.com/copyright"
         },
         {
           "rel" : "author",
           "href" : "http://blog.example.com/author/steve",
           "titles" :
           {
             "en-us" : "The Magical World of Steve",
             "fr" : "Le Monde Magique de Steve"
           },
           "properties" :
           {
             "http://example.com/role" : "editor"
           }
         }

       ]
     }

In the above example, we see that the server returned a list of
aliases, properties, and links related to the subject URL.  The links
contain references to information for each link relation type.  For
the author link, the server provided a reference to the author's
blog, along with a title for the blog in two languages.  The server
also returned a single property related to the author, indicating the
author's role as editor of the blog.

It is worth noting that, while the server returned just two links in
the "links" array in this example, a server might return any number
of links when queried.
