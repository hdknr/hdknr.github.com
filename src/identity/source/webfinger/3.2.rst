3.2. Identity Provider Discovery for OpenID Connect
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose Carol wishes to authenticate with a web site she visits 
using OpenID Connect :term:`[18]`.  
She would provide the web site with her OpenID Connect identifier, 
say carol@example.com.  
The visited web site would perform a WebFinger query 
looking for the :term:`OpenID Connect Provider`.  

Since the site is interested in only one particular link relation, 
the WebFinger resource might utilize the "rel" parameter 
as described in :ref:`Section 4.3 <webfinger.4.3>`:

::

     GET /.well-known/webfinger?
            resource=acct%3Acarol%40example.com&
            rel=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer
            HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com

The server might respond like this:

::

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
     Content-Type: application/jrd+json

     {
       "subject" : "acct:carol@example.com",
       "links" :
       [
         {
           "rel" : "http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer",
           "href" : "https://openid.example.com"
         }
       ]
     }

Since the "rel" parameter only serves to filter the link relations
returned by the resource, 
other name/value pairs in the response, 
including any aliases or properties, would be returned.  
Also, 
since support for the "rel" parameter is not guaranteed, 
the client must not assume the "links" array will contain only the requested link relation.
