10.4.1.  The Registration Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The registration template for WebFinger properties is:

          o Property Identifier:

          o Link Type:

          o Description:

          o Reference:

          o Notes: [optional]

The "Property Identifier" must be a URI that identifies the property
being registered.

The "Link Type" contains the name of a link relation type with which
this property identifier is used.  If the property is a subject-
specific property, then this field is specified as "N/A".

The "Description" is intended to explain the purpose of the property.

The "Reference" field points to the specification that defines the
registered property.

The optional "Notes" field is for conveying any useful information
about the property that might be of value to implementers.
