7.1. Purpose for the "acct" Link Relation
---------------------------------------------------------------

Users of some services might have an "**acct**" URI 
that looks significantly different from his or her email address, 
perhaps using an entirely different domain name.  
It is also possible for a user have **multiple accounts** that 
a user wants to advertise and that a WebFinger client may want to query.  
To address both of these needs,
this specification defines the "**acct**" :term:`link relation`.

Since an account may make a reference to one or more different accounts, 
WebFinger clients MUST take steps to avoid loops wherein two accounts, 
directly or indirectly, refer the client to each other.

There are no limits on the number of "**acct**" :term:`link relations` 
that might be returned in a WebFinger query.

An "**acct**" :term:`link relation` used within the context of a WebFinger query
for a user's account MUST NOT return "acct" link relations for another individual.
