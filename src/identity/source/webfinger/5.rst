5.  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
============================================================

WebFinger resources might not be accessible from a web browser due to
"Same-Origin" policies.  The current best practice is to make
resources available to browsers through Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
(CORS) [7], and servers MUST include the Access-Control-Allow-Origin
HTTP header in responses.  Servers SHOULD support the least
restrictive setting by allowing any domain access to the WebFinger
resource:

::

      Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *


There are cases where defaulting to the least restrictive setting is
not appropriate.  For example, a server on an intranet that provides
sensitive company information SHOULD NOT allow CORS requests from any
domain, as that could allow leaking of that sensitive information.  A
server that wishes to restrict access to information from external
entities SHOULD use a more restrictive Access-Control-Allow-Origin
header.
