5. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
============================================================

WebFinger resources might not be accessible from a web browser 
due to "Same-Origin" policies.  
The current best practice is to make resources available to browsers 
through Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (:term:`CORS`) :term:`[9]`, 
and servers MUST include the :term:`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
HTTP header in responses.  
Servers SHOULD support the least restrictive setting 
by allowing any domain access to the WebFinger resource:

::

      Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

There are cases where defaulting to the least restrictive setting is
not appropriate, 
for example a server on an intranet that 
provides sensitive company information SHOULD NOT allow CORS requests from any domain, 
as that could allow leaking of that sensitive information.  
A server that wishes to restrict access to information from external entities 
SHOULD use a more restrictive **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header.
