9.4.  Information Reliability
---------------------------------------

A WebFinger resource has no means of ensuring that information
provided by a user is accurate.  Likewise, neither the resource nor
the client can be absolutely guaranteed that information has not been
manipulated either at the server or along the communication path
between the client and server.  Use of HTTPS helps to address some
concerns with manipulation of information along the communication
path, but it clearly cannot address issues where the resource
provided incorrect information, either due to being provided false
information or due to malicious behavior on the part of the server
administrator.  As with any information service available on the
Internet, users should be wary of information received from untrusted
sources.
