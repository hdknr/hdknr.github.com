4. WebFinger Protocol
=======================================

A WebFinger resource is a well-known URI :term:`[3]` 
using the HTTPS scheme.
WebFinger resources MUST NOT be served with any other URI scheme (such as HTTP).

A WebFinger resource is always given a query target, 
which is another URI that identifies the entity whose information is sought.  
GET requests to a WebFinger resource convey the query target 
in the "resource" parameter in the WebFinger URI's query string; 
see :ref:`Section 4.1 <webfinger.4.1>` for details.

The WebFinger resource returns a JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD) 
as the resource representation to convey information 
about an entity on the Internet.  
Also, the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) :term:`[9]` 
specification is utilized to facilitate queries made via a web browser.
