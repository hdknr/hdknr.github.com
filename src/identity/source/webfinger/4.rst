4. Example Uses of WebFinger
====================================

In this section, 
we describe just a few sample uses for WebFinger and show what the protocol looks like.  
This is not an exhaustive list of possible uses and the entire section should be considered non-normative.  
The list of potential use cases is virtually unlimited
since a user can share any kind of machine-consumable information via WebFinger.
