4.1. Constructing a WebFinger Request URI
------------------------------------------------


   This specification defines parameters that can be passed from the
   client to the WebFinger resource when issuing a request.  These
   parameters, "resource" and "rel", and the parameter values are
   included in the query component of the URI (see Section 3.4 of RFC
   3986).  To construct the query component, the client performs the
   following steps.  First, each parameter value is percent-encoded, as
   per Section 2.1 of RFC 3986.  The encoding is done to conform to the
   query production in Section 3.4 of that specification, with the
   addition that any instances of the "=" and "&" characters within the
   parameter values are also percent-encoded.  Next, the client
   constructs a string to be placed in the query component by
   concatenating the name of the first parameter together with an equal
   sign ("=") and the percent-encoded parameter value.  For any
   subsequent parameters, the client appends an ampersand ("&") to the
   string, the name of the next parameter, an equal sign, and the
   parameter value.  The client MUST NOT insert any spaces while
   constructing the string.  The order in which the client places each
   attribute-and-value pair within the query component does not matter
   in the interpretation of the query component.
