4.4.1.  subject
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The value of the "subject" member is a URI that identifies the entity
that the JRD describes.

The "subject" value returned by a WebFinger resource MAY differ from
the value of the "resource" parameter used in the client's request.
This might happen, for example, when the subject's identity changes
(e.g., a user moves his or her account to another service) or when
the resource prefers to express URIs in canonical form.

The "subject" member SHOULD be present in the JRD.
