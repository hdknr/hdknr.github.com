1. Introduction
======================

WebFinger is used to discover information about **people** or 
**other entities** on the Internet 
that are identified by a URI :term:`[6]` or IRI :term:`[7]` 
using standard Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) :term:`[2]` methods 
over a secure transport :term:`[14]`.  

A WebFinger server returns a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) :term:`[5]` object 
that describes a resource that is queried.  
The JSON object is referred to as the JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD).

.. note::
    - JWD というJSONを返します


For a person, 
the kinds of information that might be discoverable via WebFinger 
include a 
personal profile address, 
identity service,
telephone number, or preferred avatar.  

.. note::
    - 人に大しては個人属性を返します

For other entities on the Internet, 
a WebFinger server might return JRDs 
containing :term:`link relations` that allow a client to discover, 
for example, 
the amount of toner in a printer 
or the physical location of a server.

.. note::
    - 物に関しては、リンクリレーションを返します。
      (サーバーの場所とか)


Information returned via WebFinger might be for direct human consumption 
(e.g., looking up someone's phone number), 
or it might be used by systems to help carry out some operation 
(e.g., facilitate logging into a web site by determining a user's identity service).

Use of WebFinger is illustrated in the examples in :ref:`Section 3 <webfinger.3>` and
described more formally in :ref:`Section 4 <webfinger.4>`.
