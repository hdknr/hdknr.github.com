1. Introduction
======================

There is a utility found on UNIX systems called ":term:`finger`" [15] 
that allows a person to access information about another person.  
The information being queried might be on a computer anywhere in the world.  
The information returned via "finger" is simply **a plain text file** 
that contains unstructured information provided by the queried user.

WebFinger borrows the concept of the legacy finger protocol, 
but introduces a very different approach to sharing information.  
Rather than returning a simple unstructured text file, 
Webfinger uses structured documents that contain link relations.  
These link relations point to information a **user** or **entity** on the Internet
wishes to expose.  

For a person, the kinds of information that might be exposed 
include a personal profile address, identity service,
telephone number, or preferred avatar.  
WebFinger may also be used to learn information 
about objects on the network, such as the amount of toner in a printer 
or the physical location of a server.

Information returned via WebFinger might be for direct human consumption 
(e.g., another user's phone number) 
or it might be used by systems to help carry out some operation 
(e.g., facilitate logging into a web site by determining a user's identification service).
