4.5. WebFinger and URIs
---------------------------

WebFinger requests include a "resource" parameter (see :ref:`Section 4.1 <webfinger.4.1>`)
specifying the URI of an account, device, or other entity.  
WebFinger is neutral regarding the scheme of such a URI: 
it could be an "acct" URI :term:`[7]`, an "http" or "https" URI, a 
"mailto" URI :term:`[21]`, or some other scheme.

To perform a WebFinger lookup on an account specific to the host
being queried, 
use of the ":term:`acct`" URI scheme is recommended, 
since it explicitly identifies an account accessible via WebFinger.  
Further, 
the "acct" URI scheme is not associated with other protocols as, 
by way of example, 
the "mailto" URI scheme is associated with email.

Since not every host offers email service, 
using the "mailto" URI scheme is not ideal 
for identifying user accounts on all hosts.  
That said, 
use of the "mailto" URI scheme would be ideal for use with WebFinger 
to discover mail server configuration information for a user.
