3.1.  Identity Provider Discovery for OpenID Connect
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose Carol wishes to authenticate with a web site she visits using
OpenID Connect [15].  She would provide the web site with her OpenID
Connect identifier, say carol@example.com.  The visited web site
would perform a WebFinger query looking for the OpenID Connect
provider.  Since the site is interested in only one particular link
relation, the WebFinger resource might utilize the "rel" parameter as
described in Section 4.3:

::

     GET /.well-known/webfinger?
            resource=acct%3Acarol%40example.com&
            rel=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer
            HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com

The server might respond like this:

::

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
     Content-Type: application/jrd+json

     {
       "subject" : "acct:carol@example.com",
       "links" :
       [
         {
           "rel" : "http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer",
           "href" : "https://openid.example.com"
         }
       ]
     }

Since the "rel" parameter only serves to filter the link relations
returned by the resource, other name/value pairs in the response,
including any aliases or properties, would be returned.  Also, since
support for the "rel" parameter is not guaranteed, the client must
not assume the "links" array will contain only the requested link
relation.
