4.4.4.4.  titles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "titles" object comprises zero or more name/value pairs whose
names are a language tag [11] or the string "und".  The string is
human-readable and describes the link relation.  More than one title
for the link relation MAY be provided for the benefit of users who
utilize the link relation, and, if used, a language identifier SHOULD
be duly used as the name.  If the language is unknown or unspecified,
then the name is "und".

A JRD SHOULD NOT include more than one title identified with the same
language tag (or "und") within the link relation object.  Meaning is
undefined if a link relation object includes more than one title
named with the same language tag (or "und"), though this MUST NOT be
treated as an error.  A client MAY select whichever title or titles
it wishes to utilize.

Here is an example of the "titles" object:

.. code-block:: javascript

     "titles" :
     {
       "en-us" : "The Magical World of Steve",
       "fr" : "Le Monde Magique de Steve"
     }

The "titles" member is OPTIONAL in the link relation object.
