4.4.4.4. titles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   The "titles" object comprises zero or more name/value pairs whose
   name is a language tag [13] or the string "default".  The string is
   human-readable and describes the link relation.  More than one title
   for the link relation MAY be provided for the benefit of users who
   utilize the link relation and, if used, a language identifier SHOULD
   be duly used as the name.  If the language is unknown or unspecified,
   then the name is "default".

   A JRD SHOULD NOT include more than one title identified with the same
   language tag (or "default") within the link relation object.  Meaning
   is undefined if a link relation object includes more than one title
   named with the same language tag (or "default"), though this MUST NOT
   be treated as an error.  A client MAY select whichever title or
   titles it wishes to utilize.

   Here is an example of the titles object:

     "titles" :
     {
       "en-us" : "The Magical World of Bob",
       "fr" : "Le Monde Magique de Bob"
     }

   The "titles" member is OPTIONAL in the link relation object.
