8.5.  One URI, Multiple Applications
------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to be mindful of the fact that different WebFinger
applications might specify the use of the same URI scheme, and in
effect, the same URI for different purposes.  That should not be a
problem, since each of property identifier (see Sections 4.4.3 and
4.4.4.5) and link relation type would be uniquely defined for a
specific application.

It should be noted that when a client requests information about a
particular URI and receives a response with a number of different
property identifiers or link relation types that the response is
providing information about the URI without any particular semantics.

How the client interprets the information SHOULD be in accordance
with the particular application specification or set of
specifications the client implements.

Any syntactically valid properties or links the client receives and
that are not fully understood SHOULD be ignored and SHOULD NOT cause
the client to report an error.
