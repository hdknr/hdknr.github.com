3. Overview
============================

WebFinger enables the discovery of information about accounts,
devices, and other entities that are associated with web-accessible domains.  
In essence, there are two steps to discovering such information:

   1. By querying the **domain** itself, one can find out how to discover
      information about **accounts**, **devices**, and other associated with
      that domain.

   2. By then querying an **entity** at the domain, 
      one will find links to more detailed information, 
      which can then be queried individually.

To enable such functionality, 
WebFinger makes heavy use of :term:`well-known` URIs as defined in :rfc:`5785` [3] 
and ":term:`Link Relations`" as defined in :rfc:`5988` [3].  
Briefly, 
a :term:`link` is a **typed connection** between two web resources 
that are identified by :term:`Internationalized Resource Identifiers` (:term:`IRIs`) [14]; 
this connection consists of a :term:`context IRI`, a :term:`link relation type`, 
a :term:`target IRI`, and optionally some :term:`target attributes`, 
resulting in statements of the form "{:term:`context IRI`} has a {:term:`relation type`} resource 
at {:term:`target IRI`}, which has {:term:`target attributes`}".  
When used in the :term:`Link HTTP header`, 
the :term:`context IRI` is the :term:`IRI` of the requested resource, 
the :term:`relation type` is the value of the ":term:`rel`" parameter, 
the :term:`target IRI` is :term:`URI-Reference` contained in the :term:`Link header`, 
and the :term:`target attributes` are the parameters such as 
"hreflang", 
"media", 
"title", 
"title*", 
"type", and any other :term:`link-extension parameters`.

Thus the framework for WebFinger consists of several building blocks:

   1. To query the domain, 
      one requests a :term:`web host metadata file` [10] 
      located at a :term:`well-known URI` of 
      **/.well-known/host-meta** at the domain of interest.

   2. The web server at the domain returns an :term:`Extensible Resource Descriptor` (:term:`XRD`) 
      or a JavaScript Object Notation (:term:`JSON`) Resource Descriptor (:term:`JRD`) document, 
      including a :term:`Link-based Resource Descriptor Document` (:term:`LRDD`) :term:`link relation`.

   3. To discover information about accounts, devices, or other entities
      associated with the domain, 
      one requests the actual :term:`Link-based Resource Descriptor Document` 
      associated with a particular URI at the domain 
      (e.g., an ':term:`acct`' URI, 'http' URI', or 'mailto' URI).

   4. The web server at the domain returns an :term:`XRD` or :term:`JRD` document about
      the requested URI, 
      which includes specialized :term:`link relations` pointing to resources 
      that contain more detailed information about the entity.

This model is illustrated in the examples under :ref:`Section 4 <webfinger.4>`, 
then described more formally under :ref:`Section 5 <webfinger.5>`. 
Note that steps 2 and 3 above may be accomplished simultaneously 
by utilizing the "resource" parameter defined in :ref:`Section 5.2 <webfinger.5.2>`.
