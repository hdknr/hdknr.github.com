4.4. The JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD)
------------------------------------------


   The JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD), originally introduced in RFC 6415
   [19] and based on the Extensible Resource Descriptor (XRD) format
   [20], is a JSON object that comprises the following name/value pairs:

        o subject
        o aliases
        o properties
        o links

   The member "subject" is a name/value pair whose value is a string,
   "aliases" is an array of strings, "properties" is an object
   comprising name/value pairs whose values are strings, and "links" is
   an array of objects that contain link relation information.

   When processing a JRD, the client MUST ignore any unknown member and
   not treat the presence of an unknown member as an error.
