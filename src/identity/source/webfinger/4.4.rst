4.4.  The JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD)
--------------------------------------------

The JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD), originally introduced in RFC 6415
[16] and based on the Extensible Resource Descriptor (XRD) format
[17], is a JSON object that comprises the following name/value pairs:

        - subject
        - aliases
        - properties
        - links

The member "subject" is a name/value pair whose value is a string,
"aliases" is an array of strings, "properties" is an object
comprising name/value pairs whose values are strings, and "links" is
an array of objects that contain link relation information.

When processing a JRD, the client MUST ignore any unknown member and
not treat the presence of an unknown member as an error.

Below, each of these members of the JRD is described in more detail.
