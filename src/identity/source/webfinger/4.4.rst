4.4. Retrieving Device Information
------------------------------------------------------------

While the examples thus far have been focused on information 
about humans, 
WebFinger does not limit queries to only those that use the :term:`account URI` scheme.  

Any URI scheme that contains domain information MAY be used with WebFinger.  
Let's suppose there are devices on the network like printers 
and you would like to check the current toner level for a particular printer 
identified via the URI like **device:p1.example.com**.  
While the "device" URI scheme is not presently specified, 
we use it here for illustrative purposes.


Following the procedures similar to those above, 
a query may be issued to get :term:`link relations` 
specific to this URI like this:

::

     GET /lrdd/?format=json&uri=device%3Ap1.example.com HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com

The :term:`link relations` that are returned may be quite different than those for user accounts.  
Perhaps we may see a response like this:

::

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
     Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

     {
       "subject" : "device:p1.example.com",
       "links" :
       [
         {
           "rel" : "tipsi",
           "href" : "http://192.168.1.5/npap/"
         }
       ]
     }

While this example is entirely fictitious, 
you can imagine that perhaps the Transport Independent, 
Printer/System Interface [19] may be enhanced with a web interface 
that allows a device that understands the TIP/SI web interface specification 
to query the printer for toner levels.
