4.3. The "rel" Parameter
----------------------------


   When issuing a request to a WebFinger resource, the client MAY
   utilize the "rel" parameter to request only a subset of the
   information that would otherwise be returned without the "rel"
   parameter.  When the "rel" parameter is used and accepted, only the
   link relation types that match the link relation types provided via
   the "rel" parameter are included in the array of links returned in
   the JRD.  If there are no matching link relation types defined for
   the resource, the "links" array in the JRD will either be absent or
   empty.  All other information present in a resource descriptor
   remains present, even when "rel" is employed.

   The "rel" parameter MAY be included multiple times in order to
   request multiple link relation types.

   The purpose of the "rel" parameter is to return a subset of "link
   relation objects" (see Section 4.4.4) that would otherwise be
   returned in the resource descriptor.  Use of the parameter might
   reduce processing requirements on either the client or server, and it
   might also reduce the bandwidth required to convey the partial
   resource descriptor, especially if there are numerous link relation
   values to convey for a given "resource" value.

   WebFinger resources SHOULD support the "rel" parameter.  If the
   resource does not support the "rel" parameter, it MUST ignore the
   parameter and process the request as if no "rel" parameter values
   were present.

   The following example presents the same example as found in Section
   3.1, but uses the "rel" parameter to select two link relations:

     GET /.well-known/webfinger?
            resource=acct%3Abob%40example.com&
            rel=http%3A%2F%2Fwebfinger.example%2Frel%2Fprofile-page&
            rel=http://webfinger.example/rel/businesscard HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com

   In this example, the client requests the link relations of type
   "http://webfinger.example/rel/profile-page" and
   "http://webfinger.example/rel/businesscard".  The server then
   responds with a message like this:

Internet-Draft                WebFinger                       March 2013


     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
     Content-Type: application/jrd+json

     {
       "subject" : "acct:bob@example.com",
       "aliases" :
       [
         "http://www.example.com/~bob/"
       ],
       "properties" :
       {
           "http://example.com/ns/role/" : "employee"
       },
       "links" :
       [
         {
           "rel" : "http://webfinger.example/rel/profile-page",
           "href" : "http://www.example.com/~bob/"
         },
         {
           "rel" : "http://webfinger.example/rel/businesscard",
           "href" : "http://www.example.com/~bob/bob.vcf"
         }
       ]
     }

   As you can see in the response, the resource representation contains
   only the link relations requested by the client, but the other parts
   of the JRD are still present.
