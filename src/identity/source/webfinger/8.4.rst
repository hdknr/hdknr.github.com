8.4.  Specification of Links
------------------------------------------------

The links returned in a WebFinger response each comprise several
pieces of information, some of which are optional 
(refer to Section 4.4.4).  

The WebFinger application specification MUST define each
link and any values associated with a link, including the link
relation type ("rel"), the expected media type ("type"), properties,
and titles.

The target URI to which the link refers (i.e., the "href"), if
present, would not normally be specified in an application
specification.  However, the URI scheme or any special
characteristics of the URI would usually be specified.  If a
particular link does not require an external reference, then all of
the semantics related to the use of that link MUST be defined within
the application specification.  Such links might rely only on
properties or titles in the link to convey meaning.
