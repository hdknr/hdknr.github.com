7.2. Example Message Exchange Using the "acct" Link Relation
------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider the following non-normative example.

Suppose Alice receives an email from bob@example.net. 
While Bob's email identifier might be in the example.net domain, 
he holds his account with an "**acct**" URI in the example.com domain.  

His email provider may provide WebFinger services 
to enable redirecting Alice when she queries for acct:bob@example.net.

Suppose Alice's client issues the following request:

::

     GET /.well-known/host-meta.json?resource=\
                            acct%3Abob%40example.net HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.net

The response that Alice's client receives back might be:

::

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
     Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

     {
       "subject" : "acct:bob@example.net",
       "links" :
       [
         {
           "rel" : "acct",
           "href" : "acct:bob@example.com"
         },
         {
           "rel" : "acct",
           "href" : "acct:bob@example.org"
         }
       ]
     }

Alice's WebFinger client could then perform queries against the URIs acct:bob@example.com 
and acct:bob@example.org in order to get the information Alice is seeking.
