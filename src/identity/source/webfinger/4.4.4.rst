4.4.4.  links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "links" array has any number of member objects, each of which
represents a link [4].  Each of these link objects can have the
following members:

        - rel
        - type
        - href
        - titles
        - properties

The "rel" and "href" members are strings representing the link's
relation type and the target URI, respectively.  The context of the
link is the "subject" (see Section 4.4.1).

The "type" member is a string indicating what the media type of the
result of dereferencing the link ought to be.

The order of elements in the "links" array MAY be interpreted as
indicating an order of preference.  Thus, if there are two or more
link relations having the same "rel" value, the first link relation
would indicate the user's preferred link.

The "links" array is OPTIONAL in the JRD.

Below, each of the members of the objects found in the "links" array
is described in more detail.  Each object in the "links" array,
referred to as a "link relation object", is completely independent
from any other object in the array; any requirement to include a
given member in the link relation object refers only to that
particular object.
