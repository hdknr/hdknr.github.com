4.4.4. links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


   The "links" array has any number of member objects, each of which
   represents a link [4]. Each of these link objects can have the
   following members:

        o rel
        o type
        o href
        o titles
        o properties

   The "rel" and "href" members are strings representing the link's
   relation type and the target IRI, respectively. The context of the
   link is the "subject" (see Section 4.4.1).

   The "type" member is a string indicating what the media type of the
   result of dereferencing the link ought to be.

   The order of elements in the "links" array indicates an order of
   preference.  Thus, if there are two or more link relations having the
   same "rel" value, the first link relation would indicate the user's
   preferred link.

   The "links" array is OPTIONAL in the JRD.

   Below, each of the members of the objects found in the "links" array
   is described in more detail.  Each object in the "links" array,
   referred to as a "link relation object", is completely independent
   from any other object in the array; any requirement to include a
   given member in the link relation object refers only to that
   particular object.
