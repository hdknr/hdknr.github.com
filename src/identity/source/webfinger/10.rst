10. Implementation Notes (Non-Normative)


A user should not be required to enter the "acct" URI scheme name
along with his account identifier into any WebFinger client.  Rather,
the WebFinger client should accept identifiers that are void of the
"acct:" portion of the identifier.  Composing a properly formatted
"acct" URI is the responsibility of the WebFinger client.
