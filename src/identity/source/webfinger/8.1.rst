8.1.  Specification of the URI Scheme and URI
------------------------------------------------------

Any application that uses WebFinger MUST specify the URI scheme(s),
and to the extent appropriate, what forms the URI(s) might take.  For
example, when querying for information about a user's account at some
domain, it might make sense to specify the use of the "acct" URI
scheme [18].  When trying to obtain the copyright information for a
web page, it makes sense to specify the use of the web page URI
(either http or https).

The examples in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 illustrate the use of different
URI schemes with WebFinger applications.  In the example in Section
3.1, WebFinger is used to retrieve information pertinent to OpenID
Connect.  In the example in Section 3.2, WebFinger is used to
discover metadata information about a web page, including author and
copyright information.  Each of these WebFinger applications needs to
be fully specified to ensure interoperability.
