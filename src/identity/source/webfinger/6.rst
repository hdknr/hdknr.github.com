6. Access Control
========================

As with all web resources, 
access to the WebFinger resource could require authentication.  
Further, 
failure to provide required credentials might result in the server 
forbidding access or providing a different response 
than had the client authenticated with the server.

Likewise, 
a WebFinger resource MAY provide different responses to
different clients based on other factors, 
such as whether the client is inside or outside a corporate network.

As a concrete example, 
a query performed on the internal corporate network might return 
link relations to employee pictures, 
whereas link relations for employee pictures might not be provided 
to external entities.

Further, 
link relations provided in a WebFinger resource representation 
might point to web resources that impose access restrictions.  
For example, 
the aforementioned corporate server may provide 
both internal and external entities with URIs to employee pictures, 
but further authentication might be required in order 
for the client to access the picture resources 
if the request comes from outside the corporate network.

The decisions made with respect to what set of link relations 
a WebFinger resource provides to one client versus another and 
what resources require further authentication, 
as well as the specific authentication mechanisms employed, 
are outside the scope of this document.
