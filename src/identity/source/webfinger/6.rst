6. The "acct" URI
========================

The "**acct**" URI takes a familiar form in looking like an email address.  
However, 
the account URI is not an email address and should not be mistaken for one.  
Quite often, 
the account URI minus the "acct:" scheme prefix may be exactly the same 
as the user's email address.

The "acct" URI syntax is defined here in Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [7] 
and borrows syntax elements from RFC 3986 [6]:

::

       acctURI      =  "acct:" userpart "@" domainpart
       userpart     =  1*( unreserved / pct-encoded )
       domainpart   =  domainlabel 1*( "." domainlabel)
       domainlabel  =  alphanum / alphanum *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
       alphanum     =  ALPHA / DIGIT

The "**acct**" URI scheme allows any character from the Unicode [12] character set 
encoded as a UTF-8 [20] string that is then percent-encoded as necessary into valid ASCII [21].  
Characters in the domainpart must be encoded to support internationalized domain names (IDNs) [13].

Characters in the userpart or domainpart that are not unreserved must be percent-encoded 
when used in a protocol or document that only supports or requires ASCII.  
When carried in a document (e.g., XRD or JRD) or protocol that supports 
the Unicode character set (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16 [22]), 
the URI strings may appear in the protocol or document's native encoding without percent-encoding.  
Such usage of a URI is commonly referred to as an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI).  
Conversion between an IRI and URI is described in Section 3 of RFC 3987 [14].
