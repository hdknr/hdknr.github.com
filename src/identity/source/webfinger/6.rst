6.  Access Control
========================

.. note::

    - 認証が必要なWebFingerに関して
    - 401(Authentication Required)ではなくて、403(Forbidden)とか返すべき
      (404 Not Found とか)
    - リクエステタの属性で異なる応答をすることも考える
    - rel(ation)の内容によっては返答内容を変えることも考える
       

As with all web resources, access to the WebFinger resource could
require authentication.  Further, failure to provide required
credentials might result in the server forbidding access or providing
a different response than had the client authenticated with the
server.

Likewise, a WebFinger resource MAY provide different responses to
different clients based on other factors, such as whether the client
is inside or outside a corporate network.  As a concrete example, a
query performed on the internal corporate network might return link
relations to employee pictures, whereas link relations for employee
pictures might not be provided to external entities.

Further, link relations provided in a WebFinger resource
representation might point to web resources that impose access
restrictions.  For example, the aforementioned corporate server may
provide both internal and external entities with URIs to employee
pictures, but further authentication might be required in order for
the client to access the picture resources if the request comes from
outside the corporate network.

The decisions made with respect to what set of link relations a
WebFinger resource provides to one client versus another and what
resources require further authentication, as well as the specific
authentication mechanisms employed, are outside the scope of this
document.
