9.1.  Transport-Related Issues
------------------------------------

Since this specification utilizes Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
(CORS) [7], all of the security considerations applicable to CORS are
also applicable to this specification.

The use of HTTPS is REQUIRED to ensure that information is not
modified during transit.  It should be acknowledged that in
environments where a web server is normally available, there exists
the possibility that a compromised network might have its WebFinger
resource operating on HTTPS replaced with one operating only over
HTTP.  As such, clients MUST NOT issue queries over a non-secure
connection.

Clients MUST verify that the certificate used on an HTTPS connection
is valid (as defined in [12]) and accept a response only if the
certificate is valid.
