10.3.  Registering Link Relation Types
------------------------------------------

RFC 5988 established a "Link Relation Types" registry that is reused
by WebFinger applications.

Link relation types used by WebFinger applications are registered in
the "Link Relation Types" registry as per the procedures of Section
6.2.1 of RFC 5988.  The "Notes" entry for the registration SHOULD
indicate if property values associated with the link relation type
are registered in the "WebFinger Properties" registry with a link to
the registry.
