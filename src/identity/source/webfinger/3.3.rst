3.3. Auto-Configuration of Email Clients
----------------------------------------------------

WebFinger could be used to auto-provision an email client 
with basic configuration data.  

Suppose that sue@example.com wants to configure her email client.  
Her email client might issue the following query:

::

     GET /.well-known/webfinger?
              resource=mailto%3Asue%40example.com HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com

The returned resource representation would contain entries 
for the various protocols, transport options, and security options.  
If there are multiple options, 
the resource representation might include a link relation 
for each of the valid options, 
and the client or Sue might select which option to choose.  
Since JRDs list link relations in a specific order, 
then the most-preferred choices could be presented first.  

Consider this response:

::

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
     Content-Type: application/jrd+json

     {
       "subject" : "mailto:sue@example.com",
       "links" :
       [
         {
           "rel" : "http://webfinger.example/rel/smtp-server",
           "properties" :
           {
             "http://webfinger.example/email/host" : "smtp.example.com",
             "http://webfinger.example/email/port" : "587",
             "http://webfinger.example/email/login-required" : "yes",
             "http://webfinger.example/email/transport" : "starttls"
           }
         },
         {
           "rel" : "http://webfinger.example/rel/imap-server",
           "properties" :
           {
             "http://webfinger.example/email/host" : "imap.example.com",
             "http://webfinger.example/email/port" : "993",
             "http://webfinger.example/email/transport" : "ssl"
           }
         }
       ]
     }

In this example, 
you can see that the WebFinger resource representation advertises 
an SMTP service and an IMAP service.  

In this example, 
the "href" entries associated with the link relation are absent.  
This is valid when there is no additional reference that needs to be made.
