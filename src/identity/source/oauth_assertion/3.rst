3.  Authentication vs. Authorization
======================================================

This specification provides a model for using assertions for
**authentication** of an OAuth client during interactions with an :term:`Authorization Server`, 
as well as the use of assertions as :term:`authorization grants`.  
It is important to note that 
the use of assertions for client authentication is orthogonal [#]_  
and separable from using assertions as an :term:`authorization` grant 
and can be used either in combination or in isolation.  
In addition, 
in scenarios when **assertion based authentication** and authorization are used in combination, 
the assertion format and processing may be redundant; under such circumstances, 
the protocol may be optimized to present a single assertion.
