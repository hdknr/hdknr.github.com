8.  Security Considerations
====================================

Authorization Providers concerned with preventing replay attacks 
may choose to implement using replay detection 
using a combination of the :term:`AssertionID` and :term:`IssuedAt`/:term:`ExpiredAt` attributes.  
Previously processed assertions MAY be de-duped and rejected based on the :term:`AssertionID`.

The addition of the validity window relieves the :term:`authorization server`
from maintaining an infinite state table of processed assertion IDs.

:term:`Authorization Servers` SHOULD consider the amount of information exposed in error responses, 
and the risk associated with exposing details of specific processing errors.  
In addition, :term:`Authorization Servers` SHOULD prevent :term:`timing attacks` 
related to cryptographic processing of the assertion.

No additional considerations beyond those described 
within the :ref:`OAuth 2.0 Protocol Framework, Section 10 [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2] <oauth_10>`.
